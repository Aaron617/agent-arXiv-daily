<summary><strong>How Do LLMs Fail In Agentic Scenarios? A Qualitative Analysis of Success and Failure Scenarios of Various LLMs in Agentic Simulations</strong> - JV Roig - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07497)</summary>

**Abstract:** We investigate how large language models (LLMs) fail when operating as autonomous agents with tool-use capabilities. Using the Kamiwaza Agentic Merit Index (KAMI) v0.1 benchmark, we analyze 900 execution traces from three representative models - Granite 4 Small, Llama 4 Maverick, and DeepSeek V3.1 - across filesystem, text extraction, CSV analysis, and SQL scenarios. Rather than focusing on aggregate scores, we perform fine-grained, per-trial behavioral analysis to surface the strategies that enable successful multi-step tool execution and the recurrent failure modes that undermine reliability. Our findings show that model scale alone does not predict agentic robustness: Llama 4 Maverick (400B) performs only marginally better than Granite 4 Small (32B) in some uncertainty-driven tasks, while DeepSeek V3.1's superior reliability derives primarily from post-training reinforcement learning rather than architecture or size. Across models, we identify four recurring failure archetypes: premature action without grounding, over-helpfulness that substitutes missing entities, vulnerability to distractor-induced context pollution, and fragile execution under load. These patterns highlight the need for agentic evaluation methods that emphasize interactive grounding, recovery behavior, and environment-aware adaptation, suggesting that reliable enterprise deployment requires not just stronger models but deliberate training and design choices that reinforce verification, constraint discovery, and adherence to source-of-truth data.

<summary><strong>The Agent Capability Problem: Predicting Solvability Through Information-Theoretic Bounds</strong> - Shahar Lutati - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07631)</summary>

**Abstract:** When should an autonomous agent commit resources to a task? We introduce the Agent Capability Problem (ACP), a framework for predicting whether an agent can solve a problem under resource constraints. Rather than relying on empirical heuristics, ACP frames problem-solving as information acquisition: an agent requires $\Itotal$ bits to identify a solution and gains $\Istep$ bits per action at cost $\Cstep$, yielding an effective cost $\Ceff = (\Itotal/\Istep), \Cstep$ that predicts resource requirements before search. We prove that $\Ceff$ lower-bounds expected cost and provide tight probabilistic upper bounds. Experimental validation shows that ACP predictions closely track actual agent performance, consistently bounding search effort while improving efficiency over greedy and random strategies. The framework generalizes across LLM-based and agentic workflows, linking principles from active learning, Bayesian optimization, and reinforcement learning through a unified information-theoretic lens. \

<summary><strong>Reinforcement Learning Integrated Agentic RAG for Software Test Cases Authoring</strong> - Mohanakrishnan Hariharan - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.06060)</summary>

**Abstract:** This paper introduces a framework that integrates reinforcement learning (RL) with autonomous agents to enable continuous improvement in the automated process of software test cases authoring from business requirement documents within Quality Engineering (QE) workflows. Conventional systems employing Large Language Models (LLMs) generate test cases from static knowledge bases, which fundamentally limits their capacity to enhance performance over time. Our proposed Reinforcement Infused Agentic RAG (Retrieve, Augment, Generate) framework overcomes this limitation by employing AI agents that learn from QE feedback, assessments, and defect discovery outcomes to automatically improve their test case generation strategies. The system combines specialized agents with a hybrid vector-graph knowledge base that stores and retrieves software testing knowledge. Through advanced RL algorithms, specifically Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Deep Q-Networks (DQN), these agents optimize their behavior based on QE-reported test effectiveness, defect detection rates, and workflow metrics. As QEs execute AI-generated test cases and provide feedback, the system learns from this expert guidance to improve future iterations. Experimental validation on enterprise Apple projects yielded substantive improvements: a 2.4% increase in test generation accuracy (from 94.8% to 97.2%), and a 10.8% improvement in defect detection rates. The framework establishes a continuous knowledge refinement loop driven by QE expertise, resulting in progressively superior test case quality that enhances, rather than replaces, human testing capabilities.

<summary><strong>Do You Feel Comfortable? Detecting Hidden Conversational Escalation in AI Chatbots</strong> - Jihyung Park, Saleh Afroogh, Junfeng Jiao - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.06193)</summary>

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLM) are increasingly integrated into everyday interactions, serving not only as information assistants but also as emotional companions. Even in the absence of explicit toxicity, repeated emotional reinforcement or affective drift can gradually escalate distress in a form of \textit{implicit harm} that traditional toxicity filters fail to detect. Existing guardrail mechanisms often rely on external classifiers or clinical rubrics that may lag behind the nuanced, real-time dynamics of a developing conversation. To address this gap, we propose GAUGE (Guarding Affective Utterance Generation Escalation), a lightweight, logit-based framework for the real-time detection of hidden conversational escalation. GAUGE measures how an LLM's output probabilistically shifts the affective state of a dialogue.

<summary><strong>PersonaMem-v2: Towards Personalized Intelligence via Learning Implicit User Personas and Agentic Memory</strong> - Bowen Jiang, Yuan Yuan, Maohao Shen, Zhuoqun Hao, Zhangchen Xu, Zichen Chen, Ziyi Liu, Anvesh Rao Vijjini, Jiashu He, Hanchao Yu, Radha Poovendran, Gregory Wornell, Lyle Ungar, Dan Roth, Sihao Chen, Camillo Jose Taylor - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.06688)</summary>

**Abstract:** Personalization is one of the next milestones in advancing AI capability and alignment. We introduce PersonaMem-v2, the state-of-the-art dataset for LLM personalization that simulates 1,000 realistic user-chatbot interactions on 300+ scenarios, 20,000+ user preferences, and 128k-token context windows, where most user preferences are implicitly revealed to reflect real-world interactions. Using this data, we investigate how reinforcement fine-tuning enables a model to improve its long-context reasoning capabilities for user understanding and personalization. We also develop a framework for training an agentic memory system, which maintains a single, human-readable memory that grows with each user over time.
In our experiments, frontier LLMs still struggle with implicit personalization, achieving only 37-48% accuracy. While they support long context windows, reasoning remains the bottleneck for implicit personalization tasks. Using reinforcement fine-tuning, we successfully train Qwen3-4B to outperforms GPT-5, reaching 53% accuracy in implicit personalization. Moreover, our agentic memory framework achieves state-of-the-art 55% accuracy while using 16x fewer input tokens, relying on a 2k-token memory instead of full 32k conversation histories. These results underscore the impact of our dataset and demonstrate agentic memory as a scalable path toward real-world personalized intelligence.

<summary><strong>Living the Novel: A System for Generating Self-Training Timeline-Aware Conversational Agents from Novels</strong> - Yifei Huang, Tianyu Yan, Sitong Gong, Xiwei Gao, Caixin Kang, Ruicong Liu, Huchuan Lu, Bo Zheng - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07474)</summary>

**Abstract:** We present the Living Novel, an end-to-end system that transforms any literary work into an immersive, multi-character conversational experience. This system is designed to solve two fundamental challenges for LLM-driven characters. Firstly, generic LLMs suffer from persona drift, often failing to stay in character. Secondly, agents often exhibit abilities that extend beyond the constraints of the story's world and logic, leading to both narrative incoherence (spoiler leakage) and robustness failures (frame-breaking). To address these challenges, we introduce a novel two-stage training pipeline. Our Deep Persona Alignment (DPA) stage uses data-free reinforcement finetuning to instill deep character fidelity. Our Coherence and Robustness Enhancing (CRE) stage then employs a story-time-aware knowledge graph and a second retrieval-grounded training pass to architecturally enforce these narrative constraints. We validate our system through a multi-phase evaluation using Jules Verne's Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea. A lab study with a detailed ablation of system components is followed by a 5-day in-the-wild diary study. Our DPA pipeline helps our specialized model outperform GPT-4o on persona-specific metrics, and our CRE stage achieves near-perfect performance in coherence and robustness measures. Our study surfaces practical design guidelines for AI-driven narrative systems: we find that character-first self-training is foundational for believability, while explicit story-time constraints are crucial for sustaining coherent, interruption-resilient mobile-web experiences.

<summary><strong>Learning When to Switch: Adaptive Policy Selection via Reinforcement Learning</strong> - Chris Tava - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.06250)</summary>

**Abstract:** Autonomous agents often require multiple strategies to solve complex tasks, but determining when to switch between strategies remains challenging. This research introduces a reinforcement learning technique to learn switching thresholds between two orthogonal navigation policies. Using maze navigation as a case study, this work demonstrates how an agent can dynamically transition between systematic exploration (coverage) and goal-directed pathfinding (convergence) to improve task performance. Unlike fixed-threshold approaches, the agent uses Q-learning to adapt switching behavior based on coverage percentage and distance to goal, requiring only minimal domain knowledge: maze dimensions and target location. The agent does not require prior knowledge of wall positions, optimal threshold values, or hand-crafted heuristics; instead, it discovers effective switching strategies dynamically during each run. The agent discretizes its state space into coverage and distance buckets, then adapts which coverage threshold (20-60\%) to apply based on observed progress signals. Experiments across 240 test configurations (4 maze sizes from 16$\times$16 to 128$\times$128 $\times$ 10 unique mazes $\times$ 6 agent variants) demonstrate that adaptive threshold learning outperforms both single-strategy agents and fixed 40\% threshold baselines. Results show 23-55\% improvements in completion time, 83\% reduction in runtime variance, and 71\% improvement in worst-case scenarios. The learned switching behavior generalizes within each size class to unseen wall configurations. Performance gains scale with problem complexity: 23\% improvement for 16$\times$16 mazes, 34\% for 32$\times$32, and 55\% for 64$\times$64, demonstrating that as the space of possible maze structures grows, the value of adaptive policy selection over fixed heuristics increases proportionally.

<summary><strong>Know your Trajectory -- Trustworthy Reinforcement Learning deployment through Importance-Based Trajectory Analysis</strong> - Clifford F, Devika Jay, Abhishek Sarkar, Satheesh K Perepu, Santhosh G S, Kaushik Dey, Balaraman Ravindran - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.06917)</summary>

**Abstract:** As Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents are increasingly deployed in real-world applications, ensuring their behavior is transparent and trustworthy is paramount. A key component of trust is explainability, yet much of the work in Explainable RL (XRL) focuses on local, single-step decisions. This paper addresses the critical need for explaining an agent's long-term behavior through trajectory-level analysis. We introduce a novel framework that ranks entire trajectories by defining and aggregating a new state-importance metric. This metric combines the classic Q-value difference with a "radical term" that captures the agent's affinity to reach its goal, providing a more nuanced measure of state criticality. We demonstrate that our method successfully identifies optimal trajectories from a heterogeneous collection of agent experiences. Furthermore, by generating counterfactual rollouts from critical states within these trajectories, we show that the agent's chosen path is robustly superior to alternatives, thereby providing a powerful "Why this, and not that?" explanation. Our experiments in standard OpenAI Gym environments validate that our proposed importance metric is more effective at identifying optimal behaviors compared to classic approaches, offering a significant step towards trustworthy autonomous systems.

<summary><strong>Mimir: Hierarchical Goal-Driven Diffusion with Uncertainty Propagation for End-to-End Autonomous Driving</strong> - Zebin Xing, Yupeng Zheng, Qichao Zhang, Zhixing Ding, Pengxuan Yang, Songen Gu, Zhongpu Xia, Dongbin Zhao - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07130)</summary>

**Abstract:** End-to-end autonomous driving has emerged as a pivotal direction in the field of autonomous systems. Recent works have demonstrated impressive performance by incorporating high-level guidance signals to steer low-level trajectory planners. However, their potential is often constrained by inaccurate high-level guidance and the computational overhead of complex guidance modules. To address these limitations, we propose Mimir, a novel hierarchical dual-system framework capable of generating robust trajectories relying on goal points with uncertainty estimation: (1) Unlike previous approaches that deterministically model, we estimate goal point uncertainty with a Laplace distribution to enhance robustness; (2) To overcome the slow inference speed of the guidance system, we introduce a multi-rate guidance mechanism that predicts extended goal points in advance. Validated on challenging Navhard and Navtest benchmarks, Mimir surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods with a 20% improvement in the driving score EPDMS, while achieving 1.6 times improvement in high-level module inference speed without compromising accuracy. The code and models will be released soon to promote reproducibility and further development. The code is available at this https URL

<summary><strong>Exploring Teenagers' Trust in Al Chatbots: An Empirical Study of Chinese Middle-School Students</strong> - Siyu Qiu, Anqi Lin, Shiya Wang, Xingyu Lan - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.06647)</summary>

**Abstract:** Chatbots have become increasingly prevalent. A growing body of research focused on the issue of human trust in AI. However, most existing user studies are conducted primarily with adult groups, overlooking teenagers who are also engaging more frequently with AI technologies. Based on previous theories about teenage education and psychology, this study investigates the correlation between teenagers' psychological characteristics and their trust in AI chatbots, examining four key variables: AI literacy, ego identity, social anxiety, and psychological resilience. We adopted a mixed-methods approach, combining an online survey with semi-structured interviews. Our findings reveal that psychological resilience is a significant positive predictor of trust in AI, and that age significantly moderates the relationship between social anxiety and trust. The interviews further suggest that teenagers generally report relatively high levels of trust in AI, tend to overestimate their AI literacy, and are influenced by external factors such as social media.

<summary><strong>CHOIR: A Chatbot-mediated Organizational Memory Leveraging Communication in University Research Labs</strong> - Sangwook Lee, Adnan Abbas, Yan Chen, Young-Ho Kim, Sang Won Lee - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.20512)</summary>

**Abstract:** University research labs often rely on chat-based platforms for communication and project management, where valuable knowledge surfaces but is easily lost in message streams. Documentation can preserve knowledge, but it requires ongoing maintenance and is challenging to navigate. Drawing on formative interviews that revealed organizational memory challenges in labs, we designed CHOIR, an LLM-based chatbot that supports organizational memory through four key functions: document-grounded Q&A, Q&A sharing for follow-up discussion, knowledge extraction from conversations, and AI-assisted document updates. We deployed CHOIR in four research labs for one month (n=21), where the lab members asked 107 questions and lab directors updated documents 38 times in the organizational memory. Our findings reveal a privacy-awareness tension: questions were asked privately, limiting directors' visibility into documentation gaps. Students often avoided contribution due to challenges in generalizing personal experiences into universal documentation. We contribute design implications for privacy-preserving awareness and supporting context-specific knowledge documentation.

<summary><strong>GENIUS: An Agentic AI Framework for Autonomous Design and Execution of Simulation Protocols</strong> - Mohammad Soleymanibrojeni, Roland Aydin, Diego Guedes-Sobrinho, Alexandre C. Dias, Maurício J. Piotrowski, Wolfgang Wenzel, Celso Ricardo Caldeira Rêgo - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.06404)</summary>

**Abstract:** Predictive atomistic simulations have propelled materials discovery, yet routine setup and debugging still demand computer specialists. This know-how gap limits Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME), where state-of-the-art codes exist but remain cumbersome for non-experts. We address this bottleneck with GENIUS, an AI-agentic workflow that fuses a smart Quantum ESPRESSO knowledge graph with a tiered hierarchy of large language models supervised by a finite-state error-recovery machine. Here we show that GENIUS translates free-form human-generated prompts into validated input files that run to completion on $\approx$80% of 295 diverse benchmarks, where 76% are autonomously repaired, with success decaying exponentially to a 7% baseline. Compared with LLM-only baselines, GENIUS halves inference costs and virtually eliminates hallucinations. The framework democratizes electronic-structure DFT simulations by intelligently automating protocol generation, validation, and repair, opening large-scale screening and accelerating ICME design loops across academia and industry worldwide.

<summary><strong>Stochasticity in Agentic Evaluations: Quantifying Inconsistency with Intraclass Correlation</strong> - Zairah Mustahsan, Abel Lim, Megna Anand, Saahil Jain, Bryan McCann - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.06710)</summary>

**Abstract:** As large language models become components of larger agentic systems, evaluation reliability becomes critical: unreliable sub-agents introduce brittleness into downstream system behavior. Yet current evaluation practice, reporting a single accuracy number from a single run, obscures the variance underlying these results, making it impossible to distinguish genuine capability improvements from lucky sampling. We propose adopting Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC), a metric from measurement science, to characterize this variance. ICC decomposes observed variance into between-query variance (task difficulty) and within-query variance (agent inconsistency), highlighting whether reported results reflect true capability or measurement noise. We evaluated on GAIA (Levels 1-3, measuring agentic capabilities across varying reasoning complexity) and FRAMES (measuring retrieval and factuality across multiple documents). We found that ICC varies dramatically with task structure, with reasoning and retrieval tasks (FRAMES) exhibit ICC=0.4955-0.7118 across models, and agentic tasks (GAIA) exhibiting ICC=0.304-0.774 across models. For sub-agent replacement decisions in agentic systems, accuracy improvements are only trustworthy if ICC also improves. We demonstrate that ICC converges by n=8-16 trials for structured tasks and n>=32 for complex reasoning, enabling practitioners to set evidence-based resampling budgets. We recommend reporting accuracy alongside ICC and within-query variance as standard practice, and propose updated Evaluation Cards capturing these metrics. By making evaluation stability visible, we aim to transform agentic benchmarking from opaque leaderboard competition to trustworthy experimental science. Our code is open-sourced at this https URL.

<summary><strong>Cognitive Control Architecture (CCA): A Lifecycle Supervision Framework for Robustly Aligned AI Agents</strong> - Zhibo Liang, Tianze Hu, Zaiye Chen, Mingjie Tang - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.06716)</summary>

**Abstract:** Autonomous Large Language Model (LLM) agents exhibit significant vulnerability to Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI) attacks. These attacks hijack agent behavior by polluting external information sources, exploiting fundamental trade-offs between security and functionality in existing defense mechanisms. This leads to malicious and unauthorized tool invocations, diverting agents from their original objectives. The success of complex IPIs reveals a deeper systemic fragility: while current defenses demonstrate some effectiveness, most defense architectures are inherently fragmented. Consequently, they fail to provide full integrity assurance across the entire task execution pipeline, forcing unacceptable multi-dimensional compromises among security, functionality, and efficiency. Our method is predicated on a core insight: no matter how subtle an IPI attack, its pursuit of a malicious objective will ultimately manifest as a detectable deviation in the action trajectory, distinct from the expected legitimate plan. Based on this, we propose the Cognitive Control Architecture (CCA), a holistic framework achieving full-lifecycle cognitive supervision. CCA constructs an efficient, dual-layered defense system through two synergistic pillars: (i) proactive and preemptive control-flow and data-flow integrity enforcement via a pre-generated "Intent Graph"; and (ii) an innovative "Tiered Adjudicator" that, upon deviation detection, initiates deep reasoning based on multi-dimensional scoring, specifically designed to counter complex conditional attacks. Experiments on the AgentDojo benchmark substantiate that CCA not only effectively withstands sophisticated attacks that challenge other advanced defense methods but also achieves uncompromised security with notable efficiency and robustness, thereby reconciling the aforementioned multi-dimensional trade-off.

<summary><strong>LocalSearchBench: Benchmarking Agentic Search in Real-World Local Life Services</strong> - Hang He, Chuhuai Yue, Chengqi Dong, Mingxue Tian, Zhenfeng Liu, Jiajun Chai, Xiaohan Wang, Yufei Zhang, Qun Liao, Guojun Yin, Wei Lin, Chengcheng Wan, Haiying Sun, Ting Su - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07436)</summary>

**Abstract:** Recent advances in large reasoning models (LRMs) have enabled agentic search systems to perform complex multi-step reasoning across multiple sources. However, most studies focus on general information retrieval and rarely explores vertical domains with unique challenges. In this work, we focus on local life services and introduce LocalSearchBench, which encompass diverse and complex business scenarios. Real-world queries in this domain are often ambiguous and require multi-hop reasoning across merchants and products, remaining challenging and not fully addressed. As the first comprehensive benchmark for agentic search in local life services, LocalSearchBench includes over 150,000 high-quality entries from various cities and business types. We construct 300 multi-hop QA tasks based on real user queries, challenging agents to understand questions and retrieve information in multiple steps. We also developed LocalPlayground, a unified environment integrating multiple tools for agent interaction. Experiments show that even state-of-the-art LRMs struggle on LocalSearchBench: the best model (DeepSeek-V3.1) achieves only 34.34% correctness, and most models have issues with completeness (average 77.33%) and faithfulness (average 61.99%). This highlights the need for specialized benchmarks and domain-specific agent training in local life services. Code, Benchmark, and Leaderboard are available at this http URL.

<summary><strong>Simple Agents Outperform Experts in Biomedical Imaging Workflow Optimization</strong> - Xuefei, Wang, Kai A. Horstmann, Ethan Lin, Jonathan Chen, Alexander R. Farhang, Sophia Stiles, Atharva Sehgal, Jonathan Light, David Van Valen, Yisong Yue, Jennifer J. Sun - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.06006)</summary>

**Abstract:** Adapting production-level computer vision tools to bespoke scientific datasets is a critical "last mile" bottleneck. Current solutions are impractical: fine-tuning requires large annotated datasets scientists often lack, while manual code adaptation costs scientists weeks to months of effort. We consider using AI agents to automate this manual coding, and focus on the open question of optimal agent design for this targeted task. We introduce a systematic evaluation framework for agentic code optimization and use it to study three production-level biomedical imaging pipelines. We demonstrate that a simple agent framework consistently generates adaptation code that outperforms human-expert solutions. Our analysis reveals that common, complex agent architectures are not universally beneficial, leading to a practical roadmap for agent design. We open source our framework and validate our approach by deploying agent-generated functions into a production pipeline, demonstrating a clear pathway for real-world impact.

<summary><strong>WAM-Flow: Parallel Coarse-to-Fine Motion Planning via Discrete Flow Matching for Autonomous Driving</strong> - Yifang Xu, Jiahao Cui, Feipeng Cai, Zhihao Zhu, Hanlin Shang, Shan Luan, Mingwang Xu, Neng Zhang, Yaoyi Li, Jia Cai, Siyu Zhu - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.06112)</summary>

**Abstract:** We introduce WAM-Flow, a vision-language-action (VLA) model that casts ego-trajectory planning as discrete flow matching over a structured token space. In contrast to autoregressive decoders, WAM-Flow performs fully parallel, bidirectional denoising, enabling coarse-to-fine refinement with a tunable compute-accuracy trade-off. Specifically, the approach combines a metric-aligned numerical tokenizer that preserves scalar geometry via triplet-margin learning, a geometry-aware flow objective and a simulator-guided GRPO alignment that integrates safety, ego progress, and comfort rewards while retaining parallel generation. A multi-stage adaptation converts a pre-trained auto-regressive backbone (Janus-1.5B) from causal decoding to non-causal flow model and strengthens road-scene competence through continued multimodal pretraining. Thanks to the inherent nature of consistency model training and parallel decoding inference, WAM-Flow achieves superior closed-loop performance against autoregressive and diffusion-based VLA baselines, with 1-step inference attaining 89.1 PDMS and 5-step inference reaching 90.3 PDMS on NAVSIM v1 benchmark. These results establish discrete flow matching as a new promising paradigm for end-to-end autonomous driving. The code will be publicly available soon.

<summary><strong>DUET: Agentic Design Understanding via Experimentation and Testing</strong> - Gus Henry Smith, Sandesh Adhikary, Vineet Thumuluri, Karthik Suresh, Vivek Pandit, Kartik Hegde, Hamid Shojaei, Chandra Bhagavatula - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.06247)</summary>

**Abstract:** AI agents powered by large language models (LLMs) are being used to solve increasingly complex software engineering challenges, but struggle with hardware design tasks. Register Transfer Level (RTL) code presents a unique challenge for LLMs, as it encodes complex, dynamic, time-evolving behaviors using the low-level language features of SystemVerilog. LLMs struggle to infer these complex behaviors from the syntax of RTL alone, which limits their ability to complete all downstream tasks like code completion, documentation, or verification. In response to this issue, we present DUET: a general methodology for developing Design Understanding via Experimentation and Testing. DUET mimics how hardware design experts develop an understanding of complex designs: not just via a one-off readthrough of the RTL, but via iterative experimentation using a number of tools. DUET iteratively generates hypotheses, tests them with EDA tools (e.g., simulation, waveform inspection, and formal verification), and integrates the results to build a bottom-up understanding of the design. In our evaluations, we show that DUET improves AI agent performance on formal verification, when compared to a baseline flow without experimentation.

<summary><strong>Partial Inverse Design of High-Performance Concrete Using Cooperative Neural Networks for Constraint-Aware Mix Generation</strong> - Agung Nugraha, Heungjun Im, Jihwan Lee - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.06813)</summary>

**Abstract:** High-performance concrete offers exceptional strength and durability but requires complex mix designs involving many interdependent variables and practical constraints. While data-driven methods have advanced predictive modeling for forward design, inverse design, which focuses on determining mix compositions that achieve target performance, remains limited, particularly in design situations where some mix variables are fixed by constraints and only the remaining variables must be determined. This study proposes a cooperative neural network framework for the partial inverse design of high-performance concrete. The framework combines two coupled neural network models, an imputation model that infers the undetermined variables and a surrogate model that predicts compressive strength. Through cooperative learning, the model generates valid and performance-consistent mix designs in a single forward pass while accommodating different constraint combinations without retraining. Its performance is compared with both probabilistic and generative approaches, including Bayesian inference based on a Gaussian process surrogate and autoencoder-based models. Evaluated on a benchmark dataset, the proposed model achieves stable and higher R-squared values of 0.87-0.92 and reduces mean squared error by an average of 50 percent compared with autoencoder baselines and by an average of 70 percent compared with Bayesian inference. The results demonstrate that the cooperative neural network provides an accurate, robust, and computationally efficient foundation for constraint-aware, data-driven mix proportioning in concrete engineering.

<summary><strong>BabelCoder: Agentic Code Translation with Specification Alignment</strong> - Fazle Rabbi, Soumit Kanti Saha, Tri Minh Triet Pham, Song Wang, Jinqiu Yang - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.06902)</summary>

**Abstract:** As software systems evolve, developers increasingly work across multiple programming languages and often face the need to migrate code from one language to another. While automatic code translation offers a promising solution, it has long remained a challenging task. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown potential for this task, yet existing approaches remain limited in accuracy and fail to effectively leverage contextual and structural cues within the code. Prior work has explored translation and repair mechanisms, but lacks a structured, agentic framework where multiple specialized agents collaboratively improve translation quality. In this work, we introduce BabelCoder, an agentic framework that performs code translation by decomposing the task into specialized agents for translation, testing, and refinement, each responsible for a specific aspect such as generating code, validating correctness, or repairing errors. We evaluate BabelCoder on four benchmark datasets and compare it against four state-of-the-art baselines. BabelCoder outperforms existing methods by 0.5%-13.5% in 94% of cases, achieving an average accuracy of 94.16%.

<summary><strong>VulnLLM-R: Specialized Reasoning LLM with Agent Scaffold for Vulnerability Detection</strong> - Yuzhou Nie, Hongwei Li, Chengquan Guo, Ruizhe Jiang, Zhun Wang, Bo Li, Dawn Song, Wenbo Guo - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07533)</summary>

**Abstract:** We propose VulnLLM-R, the~\emph{first specialized reasoning LLM} for vulnerability detection. Our key insight is that LLMs can reason about program states and analyze the potential vulnerabilities, rather than simple pattern matching. This can improve the model's generalizability and prevent learning shortcuts. However, SOTA reasoning LLMs are typically ultra-large, closed-source, or have limited performance in vulnerability detection. To address this, we propose a novel training recipe with specialized data selection, reasoning data generation, reasoning data filtering and correction, and testing-phase optimization. Using our proposed methodology, we train a reasoning model with seven billion parameters. Through extensive experiments on SOTA datasets across Python, C/C++, and Java, we show that VulnLLM-R has superior effectiveness and efficiency than SOTA static analysis tools and both open-source and commercial large reasoning models. We further conduct a detailed ablation study to validate the key designs in our training recipe. Finally, we construct an agent scaffold around our model and show that it outperforms CodeQL and AFL++ in real-world projects. Our agent further discovers a set of zero-day vulnerabilities in actively maintained repositories. This work represents a pioneering effort to enable real-world, project-level vulnerability detection using AI agents powered by specialized reasoning models.

<summary><strong>Look Twice before You Leap: A Rational Agent Framework for Localized Adversarial Anonymization</strong> - Donghang Duan, Xu Zheng - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.06713)</summary>

**Abstract:** Current LLM-based text anonymization frameworks usually rely on remote API services from powerful LLMs, which creates an inherent "privacy paradox": users must somehow disclose data to untrusted third parties for superior privacy preservation. Moreover, directly migrating these frameworks to local small-scale models (LSMs) offers a suboptimal solution with catastrophic collapse in utility based on our core findings. Our work argues that this failure stems not merely from the capability deficits of LSMs, but from the inherent irrationality of the greedy adversarial strategies employed by current state-of-the-art (SoTA) methods. We model the anonymization process as a trade-off between Marginal Privacy Gain (MPG) and Marginal Utility Cost (MUC), and demonstrate that greedy strategies inevitably drift into an irrational state. To address this, we propose Rational Localized Adversarial Anonymization (RLAA), a fully localized and training-free framework featuring an Attacker-Arbitrator-Anonymizer (A-A-A) architecture. RLAA introduces an arbitrator that acts as a rationality gatekeeper, validating the attacker's inference to filter out feedback providing negligible benefits on privacy preservation. This mechanism enforces a rational early-stopping criterion, and systematically prevents utility collapse. Extensive experiments on different datasets demonstrate that RLAA achieves the best privacy-utility trade-off, and in some cases even outperforms SoTA on the Pareto principle. Our code and datasets will be released upon acceptance.

<summary><strong>Kimi-Dev: Agentless Training as Skill Prior for SWE-Agents</strong> - Zonghan Yang, Shengjie Wang, Kelin Fu, Wenyang He, Weimin Xiong, Yibo Liu, Yibo Miao, Bofei Gao, Yejie Wang, Yingwei Ma, Yanhao Li, Yue Liu, Zhenxing Hu, Kaitai Zhang, Shuyi Wang, Huarong Chen, Flood Sung, Yang Liu, Yang Gao, Zhilin Yang, Tianyu Liu - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.23045)</summary>

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to software engineering (SWE), with SWE-bench as a key benchmark. Solutions are split into SWE-Agent frameworks with multi-turn interactions and workflow-based Agentless methods with single-turn verifiable steps. We argue these paradigms are not mutually exclusive: reasoning-intensive Agentless training induces skill priors, including localization, code edit, and self-reflection that enable efficient and effective SWE-Agent adaptation. In this work, we first curate the Agentless training recipe and present Kimi-Dev, an open-source SWE LLM achieving 60.4\% on SWE-bench Verified, the best among workflow approaches. With additional SFT adaptation on 5k publicly-available trajectories, Kimi-Dev powers SWE-Agents to 48.6\% pass@1, on par with that of Claude 3.5 Sonnet (241022 version). These results show that structured skill priors from Agentless training can bridge workflow and agentic frameworks for transferable coding agents.

<summary><strong>Embodied Referring Expression Comprehension in Human-Robot Interaction</strong> - Md Mofijul Islam, Alexi Gladstone, Sujan Sarker, Ganesh Nanduru, Md Fahim, Keyan Du, Aman Chadha, Tariq Iqbal - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.06558)</summary>

**Abstract:** As robots enter human workspaces, there is a crucial need for them to comprehend embodied human instructions, enabling intuitive and fluent human-robot interaction (HRI). However, accurate comprehension is challenging due to a lack of large-scale datasets that capture natural embodied interactions in diverse HRI settings. Existing datasets suffer from perspective bias, single-view collection, inadequate coverage of nonverbal gestures, and a predominant focus on indoor environments. To address these issues, we present the Refer360 dataset, a large-scale dataset of embodied verbal and nonverbal interactions collected across diverse viewpoints in both indoor and outdoor settings. Additionally, we introduce MuRes, a multimodal guided residual module designed to improve embodied referring expression comprehension. MuRes acts as an information bottleneck, extracting salient modality-specific signals and reinforcing them into pre-trained representations to form complementary features for downstream tasks. We conduct extensive experiments on four HRI datasets, including the Refer360 dataset, and demonstrate that current multimodal models fail to capture embodied interactions comprehensively; however, augmenting them with MuRes consistently improves performance. These findings establish Refer360 as a valuable benchmark and exhibit the potential of guided residual learning to advance embodied referring expression comprehension in robots operating within human environments.

<summary><strong>Statistic-Augmented, Decoupled MoE Routing and Aggregating in Autonomous Driving</strong> - Wei-Bin Kou, Guangxu Zhu, Jingreng Lei, Chen Zhang, Yik-Chung Wu, Jianping Wang - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.06664)</summary>

**Abstract:** Autonomous driving (AD) scenarios are inherently complex and diverse, posing significant challenges for a single deep learning model to effectively cover all possible conditions, such as varying weather, traffic densities, and road types. Large Model (LM)-Driven Mixture of Experts (MoE) paradigm offers a promising solution, where LM serves as the backbone to extract latent features while MoE serves as the downstream head to dynamically select and aggregate specialized experts to adapt to different scenarios. However, routing and aggregating in MoE face intrinsic challenges, including imprecise expert selection due to flawed routing strategy and inefficient expert aggregation leading to suboptimal prediction. To address these issues, we propose a statistic-augmented, decoupled MoE }outing and Aggregating Mechanism (MoE-RAM) driven by LM. Specifically, on the one hand, MoE-RAM enhances expert routing by incorporating statistical retrieval mechanism to match LM-extracted latent features with cached prototypical features of the most relevant experts; on the other hand, MoE-RAM adaptively reweights experts' outputs in fusion by measuring statistical distances of experts' instant features against LM-extracted latent features. Benefiting from the synergy of the statistic-augmented MoE's routing and aggregating, MoE-RAM ultimately improves the prediction performance. We take the AD semantic segmentation task as an example to assess the proposed MoE-RAM. Extensive experiments on AD datasets demonstrate the superiority of MoE-RAM compared to other MoE baselines and conventional single-model approaches.

**Abstract:** High-speed, head-to-head autonomous racing presents substantial technical and logistical challenges, including precise localization, rapid perception, dynamic planning, and real-time control-compounded by limited track access and costly hardware. This paper introduces the Autonomous Race Stack (ARS), developed by the IU Luddy Autonomous Racing team for the Indy Autonomous Challenge (IAC). We present three iterations of our ARS, each validated on different tracks and achieving speeds up to 260 km/h. Our contributions include: (i) the modular architecture and evolution of the ARS across ARS1, ARS2, and ARS3; (ii) a detailed performance evaluation that contrasts control, perception, and estimation across oval and road-course environments; and (iii) the release of a high-speed, multi-sensor dataset collected from oval and road-course tracks. Our findings highlight the unique challenges and insights from real-world high-speed full-scale autonomous racing.

<summary><strong>BEDI: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Evaluating Embodied Agents on UAVs</strong> - Mingning Guo, Mengwei Wu, Jiarun He, Shaoxian Li, Haifeng Li, Chao Tao - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.18229)</summary>

**Abstract:** With the rapid advancement of low-altitude remote sensing and Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Embodied Agents based on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have shown significant potential in autonomous tasks. However, current evaluation methods for UAV-Embodied Agents (UAV-EAs) remain constrained by the lack of standardized benchmarks, diverse testing scenarios and open system interfaces. To address these challenges, we propose BEDI (Benchmark for Embodied Drone Intelligence), a systematic and standardized benchmark designed for evaluating UAV-EAs. Specifically, we introduce a novel Dynamic Chain-of-Embodied-Task paradigm based on the perception-decision-action loop, which decomposes complex UAV tasks into standardized, measurable subtasks. Building on this paradigm, we design a unified evaluation framework encompassing six core sub-skills: semantic perception, spatial perception, motion control, tool utilization, task planning and action generation. Furthermore, we develop a hybrid testing platform that incorporates a wide range of both virtual and real-world scenarios, enabling a comprehensive evaluation of UAV-EAs across diverse contexts. The platform also offers open and standardized interfaces, allowing researchers to customize tasks and extend scenarios, thereby enhancing flexibility and scalability in the evaluation process. Finally, through empirical evaluations of several state-of-the-art (SOTA) VLMs, we reveal their limitations in embodied UAV tasks, underscoring the critical role of the BEDI benchmark in advancing embodied intelligence research and model optimization. By filling the gap in systematic and standardized evaluation within this field, BEDI facilitates objective model comparison and lays a robust foundation for future development in this field. Our benchmark is now publicly available at this https URL.

**Abstract:** While cooperative perception can overcome the limitations of single-vehicle systems, the practical implementation of vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure systems is often impeded by significant economic barriers. Aerial-ground cooperation (AGC), which pairs ground vehicles with drones, presents a more economically viable and rapidly deployable alternative. However, this emerging field has been held back by a critical lack of high-quality public datasets and benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we present \textit{Griffin}, a comprehensive AGC 3D perception dataset, featuring over 250 dynamic scenes (37k+ frames). It incorporates varied drone altitudes (20-60m), diverse weather conditions, realistic drone dynamics via CARLA-AirSim co-simulation, and critical occlusion-aware 3D annotations. Accompanying the dataset is a unified benchmarking framework for cooperative detection and tracking, with protocols to evaluate communication efficiency, altitude adaptability, and robustness to communication latency, data loss and localization noise. By experiments through different cooperative paradigms, we demonstrate the effectiveness and limitations of current methods and provide crucial insights for future research. The dataset and codes are available at this https URL.

**Abstract:** Large Language Model (LLM) agents are emerging to transform daily life. However, existing LLM agents primarily follow a reactive paradigm, relying on explicit user instructions to initiate services, which increases both physical and cognitive workload. In this paper, we propose ProAgent, the first end-to-end proactive agent system that harnesses massive sensory contexts and LLM reasoning to deliver proactive assistance. ProAgent first employs a proactive-oriented context extraction approach with on-demand tiered perception to continuously sense the environment and derive hierarchical contexts that incorporate both sensory and persona cues. ProAgent then adopts a context-aware proactive reasoner to map these contexts to user needs and tool calls, providing proactive assistance. We implement ProAgent on Augmented Reality (AR) glasses with an edge server and extensively evaluate it on a real-world testbed, a public dataset, and through a user study. Results show that ProAgent achieves up to 33.4% higher proactive prediction accuracy, 16.8% higher tool-calling F1 score, and notable improvements in user satisfaction over state-of-the-art baselines, marking a significant step toward proactive assistants. A video demonstration of ProAgent is available at this https URL.

<summary><strong>FlockVote: LLM-Empowered Agent-Based Modeling for Simulating U.S. Presidential Elections</strong> - Lingfeng Zhou, Yi Xu, Zhenyu Wang, Dequan Wang - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.05982)</summary>

**Abstract:** Modeling complex human behavior, such as voter decisions in national elections, is a long-standing challenge for computational social science. Traditional agent-based models (ABMs) are limited by oversimplified rules, while large-scale statistical models often lack interpretability. We introduce FlockVote, a novel framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to build a "computational laboratory" of LLM agents for political simulation. Each agent is instantiated with a high-fidelity demographic profile and dynamic contextual information (e.g. candidate policies), enabling it to perform nuanced, generative reasoning to simulate a voting decision. We deploy this framework as a testbed on the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election, focusing on seven key swing states. Our simulation's macro-level results successfully replicate the real-world outcome, demonstrating the high fidelity of our "virtual society". The primary contribution is not only the prediction, but also the framework's utility as an interpretable research tool. FlockVote moves beyond black-box outputs, allowing researchers to probe agent-level rationale and analyze the stability and sensitivity of LLM-driven social simulations.

<summary><strong>Towards Efficient Hypergraph and Multi-LLM Agent Recommender Systems</strong> - Tendai Mukande, Esraa Ali, Annalina Caputo, Ruihai Dong, Noel OConnor - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.06590)</summary>

**Abstract:** Recommender Systems (RSs) have become the cornerstone of various applications such as e-commerce and social media platforms. The evolution of RSs is paramount in the digital era, in which personalised user experience is tailored to the user's preferences. Large Language Models (LLMs) have sparked a new paradigm - generative retrieval and recommendation. Despite their potential, generative RS methods face issues such as hallucination, which degrades the recommendation performance, and high computational cost in practical scenarios. To address these issues, we introduce HGLMRec, a novel Multi-LLM agent-based RS that incorporates a hypergraph encoder designed to capture complex, multi-behaviour relationships between users and items. The HGLMRec model retrieves only the relevant tokens during inference, reducing computational overhead while enriching the retrieval context. Experimental results show performance improvement by HGLMRec against state-of-the-art baselines at lower computational cost.

<summary><strong>SoK: Trust-Authorization Mismatch in LLM Agent Interactions</strong> - Guanquan Shi, Haohua Du, Zhiqiang Wang, Xiaoyu Liang, Weiwenpei Liu, Song Bian, Zhenyu Guan - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.06914)</summary>

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly evolving into autonomous agents capable of interacting with the external world, significantly expanding their capabilities through standardized interaction protocols. However, this paradigm revives the classic cybersecurity challenges of agency and authorization in a novel and volatile context. As decision-making shifts from deterministic code logic to probabilistic inference driven by natural language, traditional security mechanisms designed for deterministic behavior fail. It is fundamentally challenging to establish trust for unpredictable AI agents and to enforce the Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP) when instructions are ambiguous. Despite the escalating threat landscape, the academic community's understanding of this emerging domain remains fragmented, lacking a systematic framework to analyze its root causes. This paper provides a unifying formal lens for agent-interaction security.
We observed that most security threats in this domain stem from a fundamental mismatch between trust evaluation and authorization policies. We introduce a novel risk analysis model centered on this trust-authorization gap. Using this model as a unifying lens, we survey and classify the implementation paths of existing, often seemingly isolated, attacks and defenses. This new framework not only unifies the field but also allows us to identify critical research gaps. Finally, we leverage our analysis to suggest a systematic research direction toward building robust, trusted agents and dynamic authorization mechanisms.

<summary><strong>SIT-Graph: State Integrated Tool Graph for Multi-Turn Agents</strong> - Sijia Li, Yuchen Huang, Zifan Liu, Zijian Li, Jingjing fu, Lei Song, Jiang Bian, Jun Zhang, Rui Wang - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07287)</summary>

**Abstract:** Despite impressive advances in agent systems, multi-turn tool-use scenarios remain challenging. It is mainly because intent is clarified progressively and the environment evolves with each tool call. While reusing past experience is natural, current LLM agents either treat entire trajectories or pre-defined subtasks as indivisible units, or solely exploit tool-to-tool dependencies, hindering adaptation as states and information evolve across turns. In this paper, we propose a State Integrated Tool Graph (SIT-Graph), which enhances multi-turn tool use by exploiting partially overlapping experience. Inspired by human decision-making that integrates episodic and procedural memory, SIT-Graph captures both compact state representations (episodic-like fragments) and tool-to-tool dependencies (procedural-like routines) from historical trajectories. Specifically, we first build a tool graph from accumulated tool-use sequences, and then augment each edge with a compact state summary of the dialog and tool history that may shape the next action. At inference time, SIT-Graph enables a human-like balance between episodic recall and procedural execution: when the next decision requires recalling prior context, the agent retrieves the state summaries stored on relevant edges and uses them to guide its next action; when the step is routine, it follows high-confidence tool dependencies without explicit recall. Experiments across multiple stateful multi-turn tool-use benchmarks show that SIT-Graph consistently outperforms strong memory- and graph-based baselines, delivering more robust tool selection and more effective experience transfer.

<summary><strong>Reliable agent engineering should integrate machine-compatible organizational principles</strong> - R. Patrick Xian, Garry A. Gabison, Ahmed Alaa, Christoph Riedl, Grigorios G. Chrysos - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07665)</summary>

**Abstract:** As AI agents built on large language models (LLMs) become increasingly embedded in society, issues of coordination, control, delegation, and accountability are entangled with concerns over their reliability. To design and implement LLM agents around reliable operations, we should consider the task complexity in the application settings and reduce their limitations while striving to minimize agent failures and optimize resource efficiency. High-functioning human organizations have faced similar balancing issues, which led to evidence-based theories that seek to understand their functioning strategies. We examine the parallels between LLM agents and the compatible frameworks in organization science, focusing on what the design, scaling, and management of organizations can inform agentic systems towards improving reliability. We offer three preliminary accounts of organizational principles for AI agent engineering to attain reliability and effectiveness, through balancing agency and capabilities in agent design, resource constraints and performance benefits in agent scaling, and internal and external mechanisms in agent management. Our work extends the growing exchanges between the operational and governance principles of AI systems and social systems to facilitate system integration.

<summary><strong>SimuHome: A Temporal- and Environment-Aware Benchmark for Smart Home LLM Agents</strong> - Gyuhyeon Seo, Jungwoo Yang, Junseong Pyo, Nalim Kim, Jonggeun Lee, Yohan Jo - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.24282)</summary>

**Abstract:** Large Language Model (LLM) agents excel at multi-step, tool-augmented tasks. However, smart homes introduce distinct challenges, requiring agents to handle latent user intents, temporal dependencies, device constraints, scheduling, and more. The main bottlenecks for developing smart home agents with such capabilities include the lack of a realistic simulation environment where agents can interact with devices and observe the results, as well as a challenging benchmark to evaluate them. To address this, we introduce $\textbf{SimuHome}$, a time-accelerated home environment that simulates smart devices, supports API calls, and reflects changes in environmental variables. By building the simulator on the Matter protocol, the global industry standard for smart home communication, SimuHome provides a high-fidelity environment, and agents validated in SimuHome can be deployed on real Matter-compliant devices with minimal adaptation. We provide a challenging benchmark of 600 episodes across twelve user query types that require the aforementioned capabilities. Our evaluation of 16 agents under a unified ReAct framework reveals distinct capabilities and limitations across models. Models under 7B parameters exhibited negligible performance across all query types. Even GPT-4.1, the best-performing standard model, struggled with implicit intent inference, state verification, and particularly temporal scheduling. While reasoning models such as GPT-5.1 consistently outperformed standard models on every query type, they required over three times the average inference time, which can be prohibitive for real-time smart home applications. This highlights a critical trade-off between task performance and real-world practicality.

**Abstract:** This paper introduces CryptoBench, the first expert-curated, dynamic benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate the real-world capabilities of Large Language Model (LLM) agents in the uniquely demanding and fast-paced cryptocurrency domain. Unlike general-purpose agent benchmarks for search and prediction, professional crypto analysis presents specific challenges: \emph{extreme time-sensitivity}, \emph{a highly adversarial information environment}, and the critical need to synthesize data from \emph{diverse, specialized sources}, such as on-chain intelligence platforms and real-time Decentralized Finance (DeFi) dashboards. CryptoBench thus serves as a much more challenging and valuable scenario for LLM agent assessment. To address these challenges, we constructed a live, dynamic benchmark featuring 50 questions per month, expertly designed by crypto-native professionals to mirror actual analyst workflows. These tasks are rigorously categorized within a four-quadrant system: Simple Retrieval, Complex Retrieval, Simple Prediction, and Complex Prediction. This granular categorization enables a precise assessment of an LLM agent's foundational data-gathering capabilities alongside its advanced analytical and forecasting skills.
Our evaluation of ten LLMs, both directly and within an agentic framework, reveals a performance hierarchy and uncovers a failure mode. We observe a \textit{retrieval-prediction imbalance}, where many leading models, despite being proficient at data retrieval, demonstrate a pronounced weakness in tasks requiring predictive analysis. This highlights a problematic tendency for agents to appear factually grounded while lacking the deeper analytical capabilities to synthesize information.

<summary><strong>A Practitioner's Guide to Multi-turn Agentic Reinforcement Learning</strong> - Ruiyi Wang, Prithviraj Ammanabrolu - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.01132)</summary>

**Abstract:** We study what actually works and what doesn't for training large language models as agents via multi-turn reinforcement learning. Despite rapid progress, existing frameworks and definitions are fragmented, and there is no systematic formulation or analysis of which design choices matter across tasks. We address this gap by first breaking down the design space into three inter-related pillars -- environment, reward, and policy -- and empirically derive a recipe for training LLM agents in situated textual domains. In particular, we test TextWorld and ALFWorld, popular domains for testing situated embodied reasoning, as well as SWE-Gym for more software engineering style tasks. (i) For the environment, we analyze the impacts of task complexity in terms of sizes of the state and action spaces as well as optimal solution length, finding that even simple environments within a domain can provide signal on how well an agent can generalize to more complex tasks. (ii) For the reward, we ablate relative reward sparsity, observing that while dense turn-level rewards accelerate training, performance and stability is highly dependent on the choice of RL algorithm. (iii) And for the agent's policy, we explore the interplay between reward sparsity and biased (PPO, GRPO) and unbiased (RLOO) policy gradient methods in addition to showing how to find the optimal Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) to RL training ratio given a fixed budget. We distill these findings into a training recipe that guides co-design across the three pillars, facilitating research and practical efforts in multi-turn agentic RL. Code: this https URL

<summary><strong>Learning to Use AI for Learning: Teaching Responsible Use of AI Chatbot to K-12 Students Through an AI Literacy Module</strong> - Ruiwei Xiao, Xinying Hou, Ying-Jui Tseng, Hsuan Nieu, Guanze Liao, John Stamper, Kenneth R. Koedinger - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.13962)</summary>

**Abstract:** As Artificial Intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly integrated into daily life, there is a growing need to equip the next generation with the ability to apply, interact with, evaluate, and collaborate with AI systems responsibly. Prior research highlights the urgent demand from K-12 educators to teach students the ethical and effective use of AI for learning. To address this need, we designed an Large-Language Model (LLM)-based module to teach prompting literacy. This includes scenario-based deliberate practice activities with direct interaction with intelligent LLM agents, aiming to foster secondary school students' responsible engagement with AI chatbots. We conducted two iterations of classroom deployment in 11 authentic secondary education classrooms, and evaluated 1) AI-based auto-grader's capability; 2) students' prompting performance and confidence changes towards using AI for learning; and 3) the quality of learning and assessment materials. Results indicated that the AI-based auto-grader could grade student-written prompts with satisfactory quality. In addition, the instructional materials supported students in improving their prompting skills through practice and led to positive shifts in their perceptions of using AI for learning. Furthermore, data from Study 1 informed assessment revisions in Study 2. Analyses of item difficulty and discrimination in Study 2 showed that True/False and open-ended questions could measure prompting literacy more effectively than multiple-choice questions for our target learners. These promising outcomes highlight the potential for broader deployment and highlight the need for broader studies to assess learning effectiveness and assessment design.

<summary><strong>ARCANE: A Multi-Agent Framework for Interpretable and Configurable Alignment</strong> - Charlie Masters, Marta Grześkiewicz, Stefano V. Albrecht - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.06196)</summary>

**Abstract:** As agents based on large language models are increasingly deployed to long-horizon tasks, maintaining their alignment with stakeholder preferences becomes critical. Effective alignment in such settings requires reward models that are interpretable so that stakeholders can understand and audit model objectives. Moreover, reward models must be capable of steering agents at interaction time, allowing preference shifts to be incorporated without retraining. We introduce ARCANE, a framework that frames alignment as a multi-agent collaboration problem that dynamically represents stakeholder preferences as natural-language rubrics: weighted sets of verifiable criteria that can be generated on-the-fly from task context. Inspired by utility theory, we formulate rubric learning as a reconstruction problem and apply a regularized Group-Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO) procedure that balances interpretability, faithfulness, and computational efficiency. Using a corpus of 219 labeled rubrics derived from the GDPVal benchmark, we evaluate ARCANE on challenging tasks requiring multi-step reasoning and tool use. The learned rubrics produce compact, legible evaluations and enable configurable trade-offs (e.g., correctness vs. conciseness) without retraining. Our results show that rubric-based reward models offer a promising path toward interpretable, test-time adaptive alignment for complex, long-horizon AI systems.

<summary><strong>DoVer: Intervention-Driven Auto Debugging for LLM Multi-Agent Systems</strong> - Ming Ma, Jue Zhang, Fangkai Yang, Yu Kang, Qingwei Lin, Saravan Rajmohan, Dongmei Zhang - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.06749)</summary>

**Abstract:** Large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems are challenging to debug because failures often arise from long, branching interaction traces. The prevailing practice is to leverage LLMs for log-based failure localization, attributing errors to a specific agent and step. However, this paradigm has two key limitations: (i) log-only debugging lacks validation, producing untested hypotheses, and (ii) single-step or single-agent attribution is often ill-posed, as we find that multiple distinct interventions can independently repair the failed task. To address the first limitation, we introduce DoVer, an intervention-driven debugging framework, which augments hypothesis generation with active verification through targeted interventions (e.g., editing messages, altering plans). For the second limitation, rather than evaluating on attribution accuracy, we focus on measuring whether the system resolves the failure or makes quantifiable progress toward task success, reflecting a more outcome-oriented view of debugging. Within the Magnetic-One agent framework, on the datasets derived from GAIA and AssistantBench, DoVer flips 18-28% of failed trials into successes, achieves up to 16% milestone progress, and validates or refutes 30-60% of failure hypotheses. DoVer also performs effectively on a different dataset (GSMPlus) and agent framework (AG2), where it recovers 49% of failed trials. These results highlight intervention as a practical mechanism for improving reliability in agentic systems and open opportunities for more robust, scalable debugging methods for LLM-based multi-agent systems.

<summary><strong>Utilizing Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Encoder-Decoder Architecture Agents to Identify Optimal Resection Location in Glioblastoma Multiforme Patients</strong> - Krishna Arun, Moinak Bhattachrya, Paras Goel - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.06990)</summary>

**Abstract:** Currently, there is a noticeable lack of AI in the medical field to support doctors in treating heterogenous brain tumors such as Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM), the deadliest human cancer in the world with a five-year survival rate of just 5.1%. This project develops an AI system offering the only end-to-end solution by aiding doctors with both diagnosis and treatment planning. In the diagnosis phase, a sequential decision-making framework consisting of 4 classification models (Convolutional Neural Networks and Support Vector Machine) are used. Each model progressively classifies the patient's brain into increasingly specific categories, with the final step being named diagnosis. For treatment planning, an RL system consisting of 3 generative models is used. First, the resection model (diffusion model) analyzes the diagnosed GBM MRI and predicts a possible resection outcome. Second, the radiotherapy model (Spatio-Temporal Vision Transformer) generates an MRI of the brain's progression after a user-defined number of weeks. Third, the chemotherapy model (Diffusion Model) produces the post-treatment MRI. A survival rate calculator (Convolutional Neural Network) then checks if the generated post treatment MRI has a survival rate within 15% of the user defined target. If not, a feedback loop using proximal policy optimization iterates over this system until an optimal resection location is identified. When compared to existing solutions, this project found 3 key findings: (1) Using a sequential decision-making framework consisting of 4 small diagnostic models reduced computing costs by 22.28x, (2) Transformers regression capabilities decreased tumor progression inference time by 113 hours, and (3) Applying Augmentations resembling Real-life situations improved overall DICE scores by 2.9%. These results project to increase survival rates by 0.9%, potentially saving approximately 2,250 lives.

<summary><strong>ClinNoteAgents: An LLM Multi-Agent System for Predicting and Interpreting Heart Failure 30-Day Readmission from Clinical Notes</strong> - Rongjia Zhou, Chengzhuo Li, Carl Yang, Jiaying Lu - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07081)</summary>

**Abstract:** Heart failure (HF) is one of the leading causes of rehospitalization among older adults in the United States. Although clinical notes contain rich, detailed patient information and make up a large portion of electronic health records (EHRs), they remain underutilized for HF readmission risk analysis. Traditional computational models for HF readmission often rely on expert-crafted rules, medical thesauri, and ontologies to interpret clinical notes, which are typically written under time pressure and may contain misspellings, abbreviations, and domain-specific jargon. We present ClinNoteAgents, an LLM-based multi-agent framework that transforms free-text clinical notes into (1) structured representations of clinical and social risk factors for association analysis and (2) clinician-style abstractions for HF 30-day readmission prediction. We evaluate ClinNoteAgents on 3,544 notes from 2,065 patients (readmission rate=35.16%), demonstrating strong performance in extracting risk factors from free-text, identifying key contributing factors, and predicting readmission risk. By reducing reliance on structured fields and minimizing manual annotation and model training, ClinNoteAgents provides a scalable and interpretable approach to note-based HF readmission risk modeling in data-limited healthcare systems.

**Abstract:** We present AI4UI, a framework of autonomous front-end development agents purpose-built to meet the rigorous requirements of enterprise-grade application delivery. Unlike general-purpose code assistants designed for rapid prototyping, AI4UI focuses on production readiness delivering secure, scalable, compliant, and maintainable UI code integrated seamlessly into enterprise workflows. AI4UI operates with targeted human-in-the-loop involvement: at the design stage, developers embed a Gen-AI-friendly grammar into Figma prototypes to encode requirements for precise interpretation; and at the post processing stage, domain experts refine outputs for nuanced design adjustments, domain-specific optimizations, and compliance needs. Between these stages, AI4UI runs fully autonomously, converting designs into engineering-ready UI code. Technical contributions include a Figma grammar for autonomous interpretation, domain-aware knowledge graphs, a secure abstract/package code integration strategy, expertise driven architecture templates, and a change-oriented workflow coordinated by specialized agent roles. In large-scale benchmarks against industry baselines and leading competitor systems, AI4UI achieved 97.24% platform compatibility, 87.10% compilation success, 86.98% security compliance, 78.00% feature implementation success, 73.50% code-review quality, and 73.36% UI/UX consistency. In blind preference studies with 200 expert evaluators, AI4UI emerged as one of the leaders demonstrating strong competitive standing among leading solutions. Operating asynchronously, AI4UI generates thousands of validated UI screens in weeks rather than months, compressing delivery timeline

<summary><strong>Convergence of Outputs When Two Large Language Models Interact in a Multi-Agentic Setup</strong> - Aniruddha Maiti, Satya Nimmagadda, Kartha Veerya Jammuladinne, Niladri Sengupta, Ananya Jana - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.06256)</summary>

**Abstract:** In this work, we report what happens when two large language models respond to each other for many turns without any outside input in a multi-agent setup. The setup begins with a short seed sentence. After that, each model reads the other's output and generates a response. This continues for a fixed number of steps. We used Mistral Nemo Base 2407 and Llama 2 13B hf. We observed that most conversations start coherently but later fall into repetition. In many runs, a short phrase appears and repeats across turns. Once repetition begins, both models tend to produce similar output rather than introducing a new direction in the conversation. This leads to a loop where the same or similar text is produced repeatedly. We describe this behavior as a form of convergence. It occurs even though the models are large, trained separately, and not given any prompt instructions. To study this behavior, we apply lexical and embedding-based metrics to measure how far the conversation drifts from the initial seed and how similar the outputs of the two models becomes as the conversation progresses.

<summary><strong>AgenticCyber: A GenAI-Powered Multi-Agent System for Multimodal Threat Detection and Adaptive Response in Cybersecurity</strong> - Shovan Roy - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.06396)</summary>

**Abstract:** The increasing complexity of cyber threats in distributed environments demands advanced frameworks for real-time detection and response across multimodal data streams. This paper introduces AgenticCyber, a generative AI powered multi-agent system that orchestrates specialized agents to monitor cloud logs, surveillance videos, and environmental audio concurrently. The solution achieves 96.2% F1-score in threat detection, reduces response latency to 420 ms, and enables adaptive security posture management using multimodal language models like Google's Gemini coupled with LangChain for agent orchestration. Benchmark datasets, such as AWS CloudTrail logs, UCF-Crime video frames, and UrbanSound8K audio clips, show greater performance over standard intrusion detection systems, reducing mean time to respond (MTTR) by 65% and improving situational awareness. This work introduces a scalable, modular proactive cybersecurity architecture for enterprise networks and IoT ecosystems that overcomes siloed security technologies with cross-modal reasoning and automated remediation.

<summary><strong>DART: Leveraging Multi-Agent Disagreement for Tool Recruitment in Multimodal Reasoning</strong> - Nithin Sivakumaran, Justin Chih-Yao Chen, David Wan, Yue Zhang, Jaehong Yoon, Elias Stengel-Eskin, Mohit Bansal - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07132)</summary>

**Abstract:** Specialized visual tools can augment large language models or vision language models with expert knowledge (e.g., grounding, spatial reasoning, medical knowledge, etc.), but knowing which tools to call (and when to call them) can be challenging. We introduce DART, a multi-agent framework that uses disagreements between multiple debating visual agents to identify useful visual tools (e.g., object detection, OCR, spatial reasoning, etc.) that can resolve inter-agent disagreement. These tools allow for fruitful multi-agent discussion by introducing new information, and by providing tool-aligned agreement scores that highlight agents in agreement with expert tools, thereby facilitating discussion. We utilize an aggregator agent to select the best answer by providing the agent outputs and tool information. We test DART on four diverse benchmarks and show that our approach improves over multi-agent debate as well as over single agent tool-calling frameworks, beating the next-strongest baseline (multi-agent debate with a judge model) by 3.4% and 2.4% on A-OKVQA and MMMU respectively. We also find that DART adapts well to new tools in applied domains, with a 1.3% improvement on the M3D medical dataset over other strong tool-calling, single agent, and multi-agent baselines. Additionally, we measure text overlap across rounds to highlight the rich discussion in DART compared to existing multi-agent methods. Finally, we study the tool call distribution, finding that diverse tools are reliably used to help resolve disagreement.

<summary><strong>MASim: Multilingual Agent-Based Simulation for Social Science</strong> - Xuan Zhang, Wenxuan Zhang, Anxu Wang, See-Kiong Ng, Yang Deng - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07195)</summary>

**Abstract:** Multi-agent role-playing has recently shown promise for studying social behavior with language agents, but existing simulations are mostly monolingual and fail to model cross-lingual interaction, an essential property of real societies. We introduce MASim, the first multilingual agent-based simulation framework that supports multi-turn interaction among generative agents with diverse sociolinguistic profiles. MASim offers two key analyses: (i) global public opinion modeling, by simulating how attitudes toward open-domain hypotheses evolve across languages and cultures, and (ii) media influence and information diffusion, via autonomous news agents that dynamically generate content and shape user behavior. To instantiate simulations, we construct the MAPS benchmark, which combines survey questions and demographic personas drawn from global population distributions. Experiments on calibration, sensitivity, consistency, and cultural case studies show that MASim reproduces sociocultural phenomena and highlights the importance of multilingual simulation for scalable, controlled computational social science.

<summary><strong>DeepAgent: A Dual Stream Multi Agent Fusion for Robust Multimodal Deepfake Detection</strong> - Sayeem Been Zaman, Wasimul Karim, Arefin Ittesafun Abian, Reem E. Mohamed, Md Rafiqul Islam, Asif Karim, Sami Azam - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07351)</summary>

**Abstract:** The increasing use of synthetic media, particularly deepfakes, is an emerging challenge for digital content verification. Although recent studies use both audio and visual information, most integrate these cues within a single model, which remains vulnerable to modality mismatches, noise, and manipulation. To address this gap, we propose DeepAgent, an advanced multi-agent collaboration framework that simultaneously incorporates both visual and audio modalities for the effective detection of deepfakes. DeepAgent consists of two complementary agents. Agent-1 examines each video with a streamlined AlexNet-based CNN to identify the symbols of deepfake manipulation, while Agent-2 detects audio-visual inconsistencies by combining acoustic features, audio transcriptions from Whisper, and frame-reading sequences of images through EasyOCR. Their decisions are fused through a Random Forest meta-classifier that improves final performance by taking advantage of the different decision boundaries learned by each agent. This study evaluates the proposed framework using three benchmark datasets to demonstrate both component-level and fused performance. Agent-1 achieves a test accuracy of 94.35% on the combined Celeb-DF and FakeAVCeleb datasets. On the FakeAVCeleb dataset, Agent-2 and the final meta-classifier attain accuracies of 93.69% and 81.56%, respectively. In addition, cross-dataset validation on DeepFakeTIMIT confirms the robustness of the meta-classifier, which achieves a final accuracy of 97.49%, and indicates a strong capability across diverse datasets. These findings confirm that hierarchy-based fusion enhances robustness by mitigating the weaknesses of individual modalities and demonstrate the effectiveness of a multi-agent approach in addressing diverse types of manipulations in deepfakes.

**Abstract:** As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly operate as autonomous decision-makers in interactive and multi-agent systems and human societies, understanding their strategic behaviour has profound implications for safety, coordination, and the design of AI-driven social and economic infrastructures. Assessing such behaviour requires methods that capture not only what LLMs output, but the underlying intentions that guide their decisions. In this work, we extend the FAIRGAME framework to systematically evaluate LLM behaviour in repeated social dilemmas through two complementary advances: a payoff-scaled Prisoners Dilemma isolating sensitivity to incentive magnitude, and an integrated multi-agent Public Goods Game with dynamic payoffs and multi-agent histories. These environments reveal consistent behavioural signatures across models and languages, including incentive-sensitive cooperation, cross-linguistic divergence and end-game alignment toward defection. To interpret these patterns, we train traditional supervised classification models on canonical repeated-game strategies and apply them to FAIRGAME trajectories, showing that LLMs exhibit systematic, model- and language-dependent behavioural intentions, with linguistic framing at times exerting effects as strong as architectural differences. Together, these findings provide a unified methodological foundation for auditing LLMs as strategic agents and reveal systematic cooperation biases with direct implications for AI governance, collective decision-making, and the design of safe multi-agent systems.

**Abstract:** Recent advances in LLM-based multi-agent systems have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex decision-making scenarios such as financial trading and software engineering. However, evaluating each individual agent's effectiveness and online optimization of underperforming agents remain open challenges. To address these issues, we present HiveMind, a self-adaptive framework designed to optimize LLM multi-agent collaboration through contribution analysis. At its core, HiveMind introduces Contribution-Guided Online Prompt Optimization (CG-OPO), which autonomously refines agent prompts based on their quantified contributions. We first propose the Shapley value as a grounded metric to quantify each agent's contribution, thereby identifying underperforming agents in a principled manner for automated prompt refinement. To overcome the computational complexity of the classical Shapley value, we present DAG-Shapley, a novel and efficient attribution algorithm that leverages the inherent Directed Acyclic Graph structure of the agent workflow to axiomatically prune non-viable coalitions. By hierarchically reusing intermediate outputs of agents in the DAG, our method further reduces redundant computations, and achieving substantial cost savings without compromising the theoretical guarantees of Shapley values. Evaluated in a multi-agent stock-trading scenario, HiveMind achieves superior performance compared to static baselines. Notably, DAG-Shapley reduces LLM calls by over 80\% while maintaining attribution accuracy comparable to full Shapley values, establishing a new standard for efficient credit assignment and enabling scalable, real-world optimization of multi-agent collaboration.

<summary><strong>Analyzing Collision Rates in Large-Scale Mixed Traffic Control via Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</strong> - Muyang Fan - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.06645)</summary>

**Abstract:** Vehicle collisions remain a major challenge in large-scale mixed traffic systems, especially when human-driven vehicles (HVs) and robotic vehicles (RVs) interact under dynamic and uncertain conditions. Although Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) offers promising capabilities for traffic signal control, ensuring safety in such environments remains difficult. As a direct indicator of traffic risk, the collision rate must be well understood and incorporated into traffic control design. This study investigates the primary factors influencing collision rates in a MARL-governed Mixed Traffic Control (MTC) network. We examine three dimensions: total vehicle count, signalized versus unsignalized intersection configurations, and turning-movement strategies. Through controlled simulation experiments, we evaluate how each factor affects collision likelihood. The results show that collision rates are sensitive to traffic density, the level of signal coordination, and turning-control design. These findings provide practical insights for improving the safety and robustness of MARL-based mixed traffic control systems, supporting the development of intelligent transportation systems in which both efficiency and safety are jointly optimized.

<summary><strong>Understanding Individual Decision-Making in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning: A Dynamical Systems Approach</strong> - James Rudd-Jones, María Pérez-Ortiz, Mirco Musolesi - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07588)</summary>

**Abstract:** Analysing learning behaviour in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) environments is challenging, in particular with respect to \textit{individual} decision-making. Practitioners frequently tend to study or compare MARL algorithms from a qualitative perspective largely due to the inherent stochasticity in practical algorithms arising from random dithering exploration strategies, environment transition noise, and stochastic gradient updates to name a few. Traditional analytical approaches, such as replicator dynamics, often rely on mean-field approximations to remove stochastic effects, but this simplification, whilst able to provide general overall trends, might lead to dissonance between analytical predictions and actual realisations of individual trajectories. In this paper, we propose a novel perspective on MARL systems by modelling them as \textit{coupled stochastic dynamical systems}, capturing both agent interactions and environmental characteristics. Leveraging tools from dynamical systems theory, we analyse the stability and sensitivity of agent behaviour at individual level, which are key dimensions for their practical deployments, for example, in presence of strict safety requirements. This framework allows us, for the first time, to rigorously study MARL dynamics taking into consideration their inherent stochasticity, providing a deeper understanding of system behaviour and practical insights for the design and control of multi-agent learning processes.

<summary><strong>A Knowledge-Based Language Model: Deducing Grammatical Knowledge in a Multi-Agent Language Acquisition Simulation</strong> - David Ph. Shakouri, Crit Cremers, Niels O. Schiller - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.02195)</summary>

**Abstract:** This paper presents an initial study performed by the MODOMA system. The MODOMA is a computational multi-agent laboratory environment for unsupervised language acquisition experiments such that acquisition is based on the interaction between two language models, an adult and a child agent. Although this framework employs statistical as well as rule-based procedures, the result of language acquisition is a knowledge-based language model, which can be used to generate and parse new utterances of the target language. This system is fully parametrized and researchers can control all aspects of the experiments while the results of language acquisition, that is, the acquired grammatical knowledge, are explicitly represented and can be consulted. Thus, this system introduces novel possibilities for conducting computational language acquisition experiments. The experiments presented by this paper demonstrate that functional and content categories can be acquired and represented by the daughter agent based on training and test data containing different amounts of exemplars generated by the adult agent. Interestingly, similar patterns, which are well-established for human-generated data, are also found for these machine-generated data. As the procedures resulted in the successful acquisition of discrete grammatical categories by the child agent, these experiments substantiate the validity of the MODOMA approach to modelling language acquisition.

<summary><strong>Large Language Models Miss the Multi-Agent Mark</strong> - Emanuele La Malfa, Gabriele La Malfa, Samuele Marro, Jie M. Zhang, Elizabeth Black, Michael Luck, Philip Torr, Michael Wooldridge - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.21298)</summary>

**Abstract:** Recent interest in Multi-Agent Systems of Large Language Models (MAS LLMs) has led to an increase in frameworks leveraging multiple LLMs to tackle complex tasks. However, much of this literature appropriates the terminology of MAS without engaging with its foundational principles. In this position paper, we highlight critical discrepancies between MAS theory and current MAS LLMs implementations, focusing on four key areas: the social aspect of agency, environment design, coordination and communication protocols, and measuring emergent behaviours. Our position is that many MAS LLMs lack multi-agent characteristics such as autonomy, social interaction, and structured environments, and often rely on oversimplified, LLM-centric architectures. The field may slow down and lose traction by revisiting problems the MAS literature has already addressed. Therefore, we systematically analyse this issue and outline associated research opportunities; we advocate for better integrating established MAS concepts and more precise terminology to avoid mischaracterisation and missed opportunities.

<summary><strong>Lark: Biologically Inspired Neuroevolution for Multi-Stakeholder LLM Agents</strong> - Dheeraj Chintapalli, Rikhil Tanugula, Sunkalp Chandra - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.16978)</summary>

**Abstract:** We present Lark, a biologically inspired decision-making framework that couples LLM-driven reasoning with an evolutionary, stakeholder-aware Multi-Agent System (MAS). To address verbosity and stakeholder trade-offs, we integrate four mechanisms: (i) plasticity, which applies concise adjustments to candidate solutions; (ii) duplication and maturation, which copy high-performing candidates and specialize them into new modules; (iii) ranked-choice stakeholder aggregation using influence-weighted Borda scoring; and (iv) compute awareness via token-based penalties that reward brevity. The system iteratively proposes diverse strategies, applies plasticity tweaks, simulates stakeholder evaluations, aggregates preferences, selects top candidates, and performs duplication/maturation while factoring compute cost into final scores. In a controlled evaluation over 30 rounds comparing 14 systems, Lark Full achieves a mean rank of 2.55 (95% CI [2.17, 2.93]) and a mean composite score of 29.4/50 (95% CI [26.34, 32.46]), finishing Top-3 in 80% of rounds while remaining cost competitive with leading commercial models ($0.016 per task). Paired Wilcoxon tests confirm that all four mechanisms contribute significantly as ablating duplication/maturation yields the largest deficit ({\Delta}Score = 3.5, Cohen's d_z = 2.53, p < 0.001), followed by plasticity ({\Delta}Score = 3.4, d_z = 1.86), ranked-choice voting ({\Delta}Score = 2.4, d_z = 1.20), and token penalties ({\Delta}Score = 2.2, d_z = 1.63). Rather than a formal Markov Decision Process with constrained optimization, Lark is a practical, compute-aware neuroevolutionary loop that scales stakeholder-aligned strategy generation and makes trade-offs transparent through per-step metrics. Our work presents proof-of-concept findings and invites community feedback as we expand toward real-world validation studies.

<summary><strong>EvoMem: Improving Multi-Agent Planning with Dual-Evolving Memory</strong> - Wenzhe Fan, Ning Yan, Masood Mortazavi - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.01912)</summary>

**Abstract:** Planning has been a cornerstone of artificial intelligence for solving complex problems, and recent progress in LLM-based multi-agent frameworks have begun to extend this capability. However, the role of human-like memory within these frameworks remains largely unexplored. Understanding how agents coordinate through memory is critical for natural language planning, where iterative reasoning, constraint tracking, and error correction drive the success. Inspired by working memory model in cognitive psychology, we present EvoMem, a multi-agent framework built on a dual-evolving memory mechanism. The framework consists of three agents (Constraint Extractor, Verifier, and Actor) and two memory modules: Constraint Memory (CMem), which evolves across queries by storing task-specific rules and constraints while remains fixed within a query, and Query-feedback Memory (QMem), which evolves within a query by accumulating feedback across iterations for solution refinement. Both memory modules are reset at the end of each query session. Evaluations on trip planning, meeting planning, and calendar scheduling show consistent performance improvements, highlighting the effectiveness of EvoMem. This success underscores the importance of memory in enhancing multi-agent planning.

**Abstract:** Understanding a complicated Ethereum transaction remains challenging: multi-hop token flows, nested contract calls, and opaque execution paths routinely lead users to blind signing. Based on interviews with everyday users, developers, and auditors, we identify the need for faithful, step-wise explanations grounded in both on-chain evidence and real-world protocol semantics. To meet this need, we introduce (matex, a cognitive multi-agent framework that models transaction understanding as a collaborative investigation-combining rapid hypothesis generation, dynamic off-chain knowledge retrieval, evidence-aware synthesis, and adversarial validation to produce faithful explanations.

**Abstract:** Multi-agent systems (MAS) extend large language models (LLMs) from independent single-model reasoning to coordinative system-level intelligence. While existing LLM agents depend on text-based mediation for reasoning and communication, we take a step forward by enabling models to collaborate directly within the continuous latent space. We introduce LatentMAS, an end-to-end training-free framework that enables pure latent collaboration among LLM agents. In LatentMAS, each agent first performs auto-regressive latent thoughts generation through last-layer hidden embeddings. A shared latent working memory then preserves and transfers each agent's internal representations, ensuring lossless information exchange. We provide theoretical analyses establishing that LatentMAS attains higher expressiveness and lossless information preservation with substantially lower complexity than vanilla text-based MAS. In addition, empirical evaluations across 9 comprehensive benchmarks spanning math and science reasoning, commonsense understanding, and code generation show that LatentMAS consistently outperforms strong single-model and text-based MAS baselines, achieving up to 14.6% higher accuracy, reducing output token usage by 70.8%-83.7%, and providing 4x-4.3x faster end-to-end inference. These results demonstrate that our new latent collaboration framework enhances system-level reasoning quality while offering substantial efficiency gains without any additional training.

**Abstract:** While the advancement of large language models has spurred the development of AI agents to automate tasks, numerous use cases inherently require agents to collaborate with humans due to humans' latent preferences, domain expertise, or the need for control. To facilitate the study of human-agent collaboration, we introduce Collaborative Gym (Co-Gym), an open framework for developing and evaluating collaborative agents that engage in bidirectional communication with humans while interacting with task environments. We describe how the framework enables the implementation of new task environments and coordination between humans and agents through a flexible, non-turn-taking interaction paradigm, along with an evaluation suite that assesses both collaboration outcomes and processes. Our framework provides both a simulated condition with a reliable user simulator and a real-world condition with an interactive web application. Initial benchmark experiments across three representative tasks -- creating travel plans, writing related work sections, and analyzing tabular data -- demonstrate the benefits of human-agent collaboration: The best-performing collaborative agents consistently outperform their fully autonomous counterparts in task performance, achieving win rates of 86% in Travel Planning, 74% in Tabular Analysis, and 66% in Related Work when evaluated by real users. Despite these improvements, our evaluation reveals persistent limitations in current language models and agents, with communication and situational awareness failures observed in 65% and 40% of cases in the real condition, respectively. Released under the permissive MIT license, Co-Gym supports the addition of new task environments and can be used to develop collaborative agent applications, while its evaluation suite enables assessment and improvement of collaborative agents.

<summary><strong>Topology Matters: Measuring Memory Leakage in Multi-Agent LLMs</strong> - Jinbo Liu, Defu Cao, Yifei Wei, Tianyao Su, Yuan Liang, Yushun Dong, Yue Zhao, Xiyang Hu - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.04668)</summary>

**Abstract:** Graph topology is a fundamental determinant of memory leakage in multi-agent LLM systems, yet its effects remain poorly quantified. We introduce MAMA (Multi-Agent Memory Attack), a framework that measures how network structure shapes leakage. MAMA operates on synthetic documents containing labeled Personally Identifiable Information (PII) entities, from which we generate sanitized task instructions. We execute a two-phase protocol: Engram (seeding private information into a target agent's memory) and Resonance (multi-round interaction where an attacker attempts extraction). Over up to 10 interaction rounds, we quantify leakage as the fraction of ground-truth PII recovered from attacking agent outputs via exact matching. We systematically evaluate six common network topologies (fully connected, ring, chain, binary tree, star, and star-ring), varying agent counts $n\in\{4,5,6\}$, attacker-target placements, and base models. Our findings reveal consistent patterns: fully connected graphs exhibit maximum leakage while chains provide strongest protection; shorter attacker-target graph distance and higher target centrality significantly increase vulnerability; leakage rises sharply in early rounds before plateauing; model choice shifts absolute leakage rates but preserves topology rankings; temporal/locational PII attributes leak more readily than identity credentials or regulated identifiers. These results provide the first systematic mapping from architectural choices to measurable privacy risk, yielding actionable guidance: prefer sparse or hierarchical connectivity, maximize attacker-target separation, limit node degree and network radius, avoid shortcuts bypassing hubs, and implement topology-aware access controls.

<summary><strong>Adaptive Tuning of Parameterized Traffic Controllers via Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</strong> - Giray Önür, Azita Dabiri, Bart De Schutter - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07417)</summary>

**Abstract:** Effective traffic control is essential for mitigating congestion in transportation networks. Conventional traffic management strategies, including route guidance, ramp metering, and traffic signal control, often rely on state feedback controllers, used for their simplicity and reactivity; however, they lack the adaptability required to cope with complex and time-varying traffic dynamics. This paper proposes a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework in which each agent adaptively tunes the parameters of a state feedback traffic controller, combining the reactivity of state feedback controllers with the adaptability of reinforcement learning. By tuning parameters at a lower frequency rather than directly determining control actions at a high frequency, the reinforcement learning agents achieve improved training efficiency while maintaining adaptability to varying traffic conditions. The multi-agent structure further enhances system robustness, as local controllers can operate independently in the event of partial failures. The proposed framework is evaluated on a simulated multi-class transportation network under varying traffic conditions. Results show that the proposed multi-agent framework outperforms the no control and fixed-parameter state feedback control cases, while performing on par with the single-agent RL-based adaptive state feedback control, with a much better resilience to partial failures.

<summary><strong>Deep Neural Network-Based Aerial Transport in the Presence of Cooperative and Uncooperative UAS</strong> - Muhammad Junayed Hasan Zahed, Hossein Rastgoftar - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.06577)</summary>

**Abstract:** We present a resilient deep neural network (DNN) framework for decentralized transport and coverage using uncrewed aerial systems (UAS) operating in $\mathbb{R}^n$. The proposed DNN-based mass-transport architecture constructs a layered inter-UAS communication graph from an initial formation, assigns time-varying communication weights through a forward scheduling mechanism that guides the team from the initial to the final configuration, and ensures stability and convergence of the resulting multi-agent transport dynamics. The framework is explicitly designed to remain robust in the presence of uncooperative agents that deviate from or refuse to follow the prescribed protocol. Our method preserves a fixed feed-forward topology but dynamically prunes edges to uncooperative agents, maintains convex, feedforward mentoring among cooperative agents, and computes global desired set points through a sparse linear relation consistent with leader references. The target set is abstracted by $N$ points that become final desired positions, enabling coverage-optimal transport while keeping computation low and guarantees intact. Extensive simulations demonstrate that, under full cooperation, all agents converge rapidly to the target zone with a 10\% boundary margin and under partial cooperation with uncooperative agents, the system maintains high convergence among cooperative agents with performance degradation localized near the disruptions, evidencing graceful resilience and scalability. These results confirm that forward-weight scheduling, hierarchical mentor--mentee coordination, and on-the-fly DNN restructuring yield robust, provably stable UAS transport in realistic fault scenarios.

<summary><strong>Reformulate, Retrieve, Localize: Agents for Repository-Level Bug Localization</strong> - Genevieve Caumartin, Glaucia Melo - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07022)</summary>

**Abstract:** Bug localization remains a critical yet time-consuming challenge in large-scale software repositories. Traditional information retrieval-based bug localization (IRBL) methods rely on unchanged bug descriptions, which often contain noisy information, leading to poor retrieval accuracy. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have improved bug localization through query reformulation, yet the effect on agent performance remains unexplored. In this study, we investigate how an LLM-powered agent can improve file-level bug localization via lightweight query reformulation and summarization. We first employ an open-source, non-fine-tuned LLM to extract key information from bug reports, such as identifiers and code snippets, and reformulate queries pre-retrieval. Our agent then orchestrates BM25 retrieval using these preprocessed queries, automating localization workflow at scale. Using the best-performing query reformulation technique, our agent achieves 35% better ranking in first-file retrieval than our BM25 baseline and up to +22% file retrieval performance over SWE-agent.

<summary><strong>Non-Collaborative User Simulators for Tool Agents</strong> - Jeonghoon Shim, Woojung Song, Cheyon Jin, Seungwon KooK, Yohan Jo - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.23124)</summary>

**Abstract:** Tool agents interact with users through multi-turn dialogues to accomplish various tasks. Recent studies have adopted user simulation methods to develop these agents in multi-turn settings. However, existing user simulators tend to be agent-friendly, exhibiting only cooperative behaviors, which fails to train and test agents against non-collaborative users in the real world. To address this, we propose a novel user simulator architecture that simulates four categories of non-collaborative behaviors: requesting unavailable services, digressing into tangential conversations, expressing impatience, and providing incomplete utterances. Our user simulator can simulate challenging and natural non-collaborative behaviors while reliably delivering all intents and information necessary to accomplish the task. Our experiments on MultiWOZ and $\tau$-bench reveal significant performance degradation in state-of-the-art tool agents when encountering non-collaborative users. We provide detailed analyses of agents' weaknesses under each non-collaborative condition, such as escalated hallucinations and dialogue breakdowns. Ultimately, we contribute an easily extensible user simulation framework to help the research community develop tool agents and preemptively diagnose them under challenging real-world conditions within their own services.

<summary><strong>Internal World Models as Imagination Networks in Cognitive Agents</strong> - Saurabh Ranjan, Brian Odegaard - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.04391)</summary>

**Abstract:** The computational role of imagination remains debated. While classical accounts emphasize reward maximization, emerging evidence suggests imagination serves a broader function: accessing internal world models (IWMs). Here, we employ psychological network analysis to compare IWMs in humans and large language models (LLMs) through imagination vividness ratings. Using the Vividness of Visual Imagery Questionnaire (VVIQ-2) and Plymouth Sensory Imagery Questionnaire (PSIQ), we construct imagination networks from three human populations (Florida, Poland, London; N=2,743) and six LLM variants in two conversation conditions. Human imagination networks demonstrate robust correlations across centrality measures (expected influence, strength, closeness) and consistent clustering patterns, indicating shared structural organization of IWMs across populations. In contrast, LLM-derived networks show minimal clustering and weak centrality correlations, even when manipulating conversational memory. These systematic differences persist across environmental scenes (VVIQ-2) and sensory modalities (PSIQ), revealing fundamental disparities between human and artificial world models. Our network-based approach provides a quantitative framework for comparing internally-generated representations across cognitive agents, with implications for developing human-like imagination in artificial intelligence systems.

<summary><strong>The Adoption and Usage of AI Agents: Early Evidence from Perplexity</strong> - Jeremy Yang, Noah Yonack, Kate Zyskowski, Denis Yarats, Johnny Ho, Jerry Ma - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07828)</summary>

**Abstract:** This paper presents the first large-scale field study of the adoption, usage intensity, and use cases of general-purpose AI agents operating in open-world web environments. Our analysis centers on Comet, an AI-powered browser developed by Perplexity, and its integrated agent, Comet Assistant. Drawing on hundreds of millions of anonymized user interactions, we address three fundamental questions: Who is using AI agents? How intensively are they using them? And what are they using them for? Our findings reveal substantial heterogeneity in adoption and usage across user segments. Earlier adopters, users in countries with higher GDP per capita and educational attainment, and individuals working in digital or knowledge-intensive sectors -- such as digital technology, academia, finance, marketing, and entrepreneurship -- are more likely to adopt or actively use the agent. To systematically characterize the substance of agent usage, we introduce a hierarchical agentic taxonomy that organizes use cases across three levels: topic, subtopic, and task. The two largest topics, Productivity & Workflow and Learning & Research, account for 57% of all agentic queries, while the two largest subtopics, Courses and Shopping for Goods, make up 22%. The top 10 out of 90 tasks represent 55% of queries. Personal use constitutes 55% of queries, while professional and educational contexts comprise 30% and 16%, respectively. In the short term, use cases exhibit strong stickiness, but over time users tend to shift toward more cognitively oriented topics. The diffusion of increasingly capable AI agents carries important implications for researchers, businesses, policymakers, and educators, inviting new lines of inquiry into this rapidly emerging class of AI capabilities.

<summary><strong>FedDSR: Federated Deep Supervision and Regularization Towards Autonomous Driving</strong> - Wei-Bin Kou, Guangxu Zhu, Bingyang Cheng, Chen Zhang, Yik-Chung Wu, Jianping Wang - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.06676)</summary>

**Abstract:** Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative training of autonomous driving (AD) models across distributed vehicles while preserving data privacy. However, FL encounters critical challenges such as poor generalization and slow convergence due to non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data from diverse driving environments. To overcome these obstacles, we introduce Federated Deep Supervision and Regularization (FedDSR), a paradigm that incorporates multi-access intermediate layer supervision and regularization within federated AD system. Specifically, FedDSR comprises following integral strategies: (I) to select multiple intermediate layers based on predefined architecture-agnostic standards. (II) to compute mutual information (MI) and negative entropy (NE) on those selected layers to serve as intermediate loss and regularizer. These terms are integrated into the output-layer loss to form a unified optimization objective, enabling comprehensive optimization across the network hierarchy. (III) to aggregate models from vehicles trained based on aforementioned rules of (I) and (II) to generate the global model on central server. By guiding and penalizing the learning of feature representations at intermediate stages, FedDSR enhances the model generalization and accelerates model convergence for federated AD. We then take the semantic segmentation task as an example to assess FedDSR and apply FedDSR to multiple model architectures and FL algorithms. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FedDSR achieves up to 8.93% improvement in mIoU and 28.57% reduction in training rounds, compared to other FL baselines, making it highly suitable for practical deployment in federated AD ecosystems.

<summary><strong>Situation-Aware Interactive MPC Switching for Autonomous Driving</strong> - Shuhao Qi, Qiling Aori, Luyao Zhang, Mircea Lazar, Sofie Haesaert - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.06182)</summary>

**Abstract:** To enable autonomous driving in interactive traffic scenarios, various model predictive control (MPC) formulations have been proposed, each employing different interaction models. While higher-fidelity models enable more intelligent behavior, they incur increased computational cost. Since strong interactions are relatively infrequent in traffic, a practical strategy for balancing performance and computational overhead is to invoke an appropriate controller based on situational demands. To achieve this approach, we first conduct a comparative study to assess and hierarchize the interactive capabilities of different MPC formulations. Furthermore, we develop a neural network-based classifier to enable situation-aware switching among controllers with different levels of interactive capability. We demonstrate that this situation-aware switching can both substantially improve overall performance by activating the most advanced interactive MPC in rare but critical situations, and significantly reduce computational load by using a basic MPC in the majority of scenarios.

<summary><strong>Robust Optimization-based Autonomous Dynamic Soaring with a Fixed-Wing UAV</strong> - Marvin Harms, Jaeyoung Lim, David Rohr, Friedrich Rockenbauer, Nicholas Lawrance, Roland Siegwart - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.06610)</summary>

**Abstract:** Dynamic soaring is a flying technique to exploit the energy available in wind shear layers, enabling potentially unlimited flight without the need for internal energy sources. We propose a framework for autonomous dynamic soaring with a fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The framework makes use of an explicit representation of the wind field and a classical approach for guidance and control of the UAV. Robustness to wind field estimation error is achieved by constructing point-wise robust reference paths for dynamic soaring and the development of a robust path following controller for the fixed-wing UAV. The framework is evaluated in dynamic soaring scenarios in simulation and real flight tests. In simulation, we demonstrate robust dynamic soaring flight subject to varied wind conditions, estimation errors and disturbances. Critical components of the framework, including energy predictions and path-following robustness, are further validated in real flights to assure small sim-to-real gap. Together, our results strongly indicate the ability of the proposed framework to achieve autonomous dynamic soaring flight in wind shear.

<summary><strong>Model Predictive Control for Cooperative Docking Between Autonomous Surface Vehicles with Disturbance Rejection</strong> - Gianpietro Battocletti, Dimitris Boskos, Bart De Schutter - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07316)</summary>

**Abstract:** Uncrewed Surface Vehicles (USVs) are a popular and efficient type of marine craft that find application in a large number of water-based tasks. When multiple USVs operate in the same area, they may be required to dock to each other to perform a shared task. Existing approaches for the docking between autonomous USVs generally consider one USV as a stationary target, while the second one is tasked to reach the required docking pose. In this work, we propose a cooperative approach for USV-USV docking, where two USVs work together to dock at an agreed location. We use a centralized Model Predictive Control (MPC) approach to solve the control problem, obtaining feasible trajectories that also guarantee constraint satisfaction. Owing to its model-based nature, this approach allows the rejection of disturbances, inclusive of exogenous inputs, by anticipating their effect on the USVs through the MPC prediction model. This is particularly effective in case of almost-stationary disturbances such as water currents. In simulations, we demonstrate how the proposed approach allows for a faster and more efficient docking with respect to existing approaches.

**Abstract:** Embodied AI systems integrate language models with real world sensing, mobility, and cloud connected mobile apps. Yet while model jailbreaks have drawn significant attention, the broader system stack of embodied intelligence remains largely unexplored. In this work, we conduct the first holistic security analysis of the Unitree Go2 platform and uncover ten cross layer vulnerabilities the "Ten Sins of Embodied AI Security." Using BLE sniffing, traffic interception, APK reverse engineering, cloud API testing, and hardware probing, we identify systemic weaknesses across three architectural layers: wireless provisioning, core modules, and external interfaces. These include hard coded keys, predictable handshake tokens, WiFi credential leakage, missing TLS validation, static SSH password, multilingual safety bypass behavior, insecure local relay channels, weak binding logic, and unrestricted firmware access. Together, they allow adversaries to hijack devices, inject arbitrary commands, extract sensitive information, or gain full physical this http URL findings show that securing embodied AI requires far more than aligning the model itself. We conclude with system level lessons learned and recommendations for building embodied platforms that remain robust across their entire software hardware ecosystem.

**Abstract:** Aerial manipulation combines the versatility and speed of flying platforms with the functional capabilities of mobile manipulation, which presents significant challenges due to the need for precise localization and control. Traditionally, researchers have relied on offboard perception systems, which are limited to expensive and impractical specially equipped indoor environments. In this work, we introduce a novel platform for autonomous aerial manipulation that exclusively utilizes onboard perception systems. Our platform can perform aerial manipulation in various indoor and outdoor environments without depending on external perception systems. Our experimental results demonstrate the platform's ability to autonomously grasp various objects in diverse settings. This advancement significantly improves the scalability and practicality of aerial manipulation applications by eliminating the need for costly tracking solutions. To accelerate future research, we open source our ROS 2 software stack and custom hardware design, making our contributions accessible to the broader research community.

<summary><strong>Exploring Adversarial Obstacle Attacks in Search-based Path Planning for Autonomous Mobile Robots</strong> - Adrian Szvoren, Jianwei Liu, Dimitrios Kanoulas, Nilufer Tuptuk - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.06154)</summary>

**Abstract:** Path planning algorithms, such as the search-based A*, are a critical component of autonomous mobile robotics, enabling robots to navigate from a starting point to a destination efficiently and safely. We investigated the resilience of the A* algorithm in the face of potential adversarial interventions known as obstacle attacks. The adversary's goal is to delay the robot's timely arrival at its destination by introducing obstacles along its original path.
We developed malicious software to execute the attacks and conducted experiments to assess their impact, both in simulation using TurtleBot in Gazebo and in real-world deployment with the Unitree Go1 robot. In simulation, the attacks resulted in an average delay of 36\%, with the most significant delays occurring in scenarios where the robot was forced to take substantially longer alternative paths. In real-world experiments, the delays were even more pronounced, with all attacks successfully rerouting the robot and causing measurable disruptions. These results highlight that the algorithm's robustness is not solely an attribute of its design but is significantly influenced by the operational environment. For example, in constrained environments like tunnels, the delays were maximized due to the limited availability of alternative routes.

<summary><strong>VIGIL: A Reflective Runtime for Self-Healing Agents</strong> - Christopher Cruz - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07094)</summary>

**Abstract:** Agentic LLM frameworks promise autonomous behavior via task decomposition, tool use, and iterative planning, but most deployed systems remain brittle. They lack runtime introspection, cannot diagnose their own failure modes, and do not improve over time without human intervention. In practice, many agent stacks degrade into decorated chains of LLM calls with no structural mechanisms for reliability. We present VIGIL (Verifiable Inspection and Guarded Iterative Learning), a reflective runtime that supervises a sibling agent and performs autonomous maintenance rather than task execution. VIGIL ingests behavioral logs, appraises each event into a structured emotional representation, maintains a persistent EmoBank with decay and contextual policies, and derives an RBT diagnosis that sorts recent behavior into strengths, opportunities, and failures. From this analysis, VIGIL generates both guarded prompt updates that preserve core identity semantics and read only code proposals produced by a strategy engine that operates on log evidence and code hotspots. VIGIL functions as a state gated pipeline. Illegal transitions produce explicit errors rather than allowing the LLM to improvise. In a reminder latency case study, VIGIL identified elevated lag, proposed prompt and code repairs, and when its own diagnostic tool failed due to a schema conflict, it surfaced the internal error, produced a fallback diagnosis, and emitted a repair plan. This demonstrates meta level self repair in a deployed agent runtime.

<summary><strong>Each Prompt Matters: Scaling Reinforcement Learning Without Wasting Rollouts on Hundred-Billion-Scale MoE</strong> - Anxiang Zeng, Haibo Zhang, Hailing Zhang, Kaixiang Mo, Liang Yao, Ling Hu, Long Zhang, Shuman Liu, Shuyi Xie, Yanshi Li, Yizhang Chen, Yuepeng Sheng, Yuwei Huang, Zhaochen Xu, Zhiqiang Zhou, Ziqin Liew - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07710)</summary>

**Abstract:** We present CompassMax-V3-Thinking, a hundred-billion-scale MoE reasoning model trained with a new RL framework built on one principle: each prompt must matter. Scaling RL to this size exposes critical inefficiencies-zero-variance prompts that waste rollouts, unstable importance sampling over long horizons, advantage inversion from standard reward models, and systemic bottlenecks in rollout processing. To overcome these challenges, we introduce several unified innovations: (1) Multi-Stage Zero-Variance Elimination, which filters out non-informative prompts and stabilizes group-based policy optimization (e.g. GRPO) by removing wasted rollouts; (2) ESPO, an entropy-adaptive optimization method that balances token-level and sequence-level importance sampling to maintain stable learning dynamics; (3) a Router Replay strategy that aligns training-time MoE router decisions with inference-time behavior to mitigate train-infer discrepancies, coupled with a reward model adjustment to prevent advantage inversion; (4) a high-throughput RL system with FP8-precision rollouts, overlapped reward computation, and length-aware scheduling to eliminate performance bottlenecks. Together, these contributions form a cohesive pipeline that makes RL on hundred-billion-scale MoE models stable and efficient. The resulting model delivers strong performance across both internal and public evaluations.

<summary><strong>RL-MTJail: Reinforcement Learning for Automated Black-Box Multi-Turn Jailbreaking of Large Language Models</strong> - Xiqiao Xiong, Ouxiang Li, Zhuo Liu, Moxin Li, Wentao Shi, Fuli Feng, Xiangnan He - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07761)</summary>

**Abstract:** Large language models are vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, threatening their safe deployment in real-world applications. This paper studies black-box multi-turn jailbreaks, aiming to train attacker LLMs to elicit harmful content from black-box models through a sequence of prompt-output interactions. Existing approaches typically rely on single turn optimization, which is insufficient for learning long-term attack strategies. To bridge this gap, we formulate the problem as a multi-turn reinforcement learning task, directly optimizing the harmfulness of the final-turn output as the outcome reward. To mitigate sparse supervision and promote long-term attack strategies, we propose two heuristic process rewards: (1) controlling the harmfulness of intermediate outputs to prevent triggering the black-box model's rejection mechanisms, and (2) maintaining the semantic relevance of intermediate outputs to avoid drifting into irrelevant content. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks show consistently improved attack success rates across multiple models, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach. The code is available at this https URL. Warning: This paper contains examples of harmful content.

**Abstract:** Artificial intelligence methods are increasingly being explored for managing wildfires and other natural hazards. In particular, reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising path towards improving outcomes in such uncertain decision-making scenarios and moving beyond reactive strategies. However, training RL agents requires many environment interactions, and the speed of existing wildfire simulators is a severely limiting factor. We introduce $\texttt{JaxWildfire}$, a simulator underpinned by a principled probabilistic fire spread model based on cellular automata. It is implemented in JAX and enables vectorized simulations using $\texttt{vmap}$, allowing high throughput of simulations on GPUs. We demonstrate that $\texttt{JaxWildfire}$ achieves 6-35x speedup over existing software and enables gradient-based optimization of simulator parameters. Furthermore, we show that $\texttt{JaxWildfire}$ can be used to train RL agents to learn wildfire suppression policies. Our work is an important step towards enabling the advancement of RL techniques for managing natural hazards.

<summary><strong>Quantifying Memory Use in Reinforcement Learning with Temporal Range</strong> - Rodney Lafuente-Mercado, Daniela Rus, T. Konstantin Rusch - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.06204)</summary>

**Abstract:** How much does a trained RL policy actually use its past observations? We propose \emph{Temporal Range}, a model-agnostic metric that treats first-order sensitivities of multiple vector outputs across a temporal window to the input sequence as a temporal influence profile and summarizes it by the magnitude-weighted average lag. Temporal Range is computed via reverse-mode automatic differentiation from the Jacobian blocks $\partial y_s/\partial x_t\in\mathbb{R}^{c\times d}$ averaged over final timesteps $s\in\{t+1,\dots,T\}$ and is well-characterized in the linear setting by a small set of natural axioms. Across diagnostic and control tasks (POPGym; flicker/occlusion; Copy-$k$) and architectures (MLPs, RNNs, SSMs), Temporal Range (i) remains small in fully observed control, (ii) scales with the task's ground-truth lag in Copy-$k$, and (iii) aligns with the minimum history window required for near-optimal return as confirmed by window ablations. We also report Temporal Range for a compact Long Expressive Memory (LEM) policy trained on the task, using it as a proxy readout of task-level memory. Our axiomatic treatment draws on recent work on range measures, specialized here to temporal lag and extended to vector-valued outputs in the RL setting. Temporal Range thus offers a practical per-sequence readout of memory dependence for comparing agents and environments and for selecting the shortest sufficient context.

<summary><strong>Auto-exploration for online reinforcement learning</strong> - Caleb Ju, Guanghui Lan - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.06244)</summary>

**Abstract:** The exploration-exploitation dilemma in reinforcement learning (RL) is a fundamental challenge to efficient RL algorithms. Existing algorithms for finite state and action discounted RL problems address this by assuming sufficient exploration over both state and action spaces. However, this yields non-implementable algorithms and sub-optimal performance. To resolve these limitations, we introduce a new class of methods with auto-exploration, or methods that automatically explore both state and action spaces in a parameter-free way, i.e.,~without a priori knowledge of problem-dependent parameters. We present two variants: one for the tabular setting and one for linear function approximation. Under algorithm-independent assumptions on the existence of an exploring optimal policy, both methods attain $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ sample complexity to solve to $\epsilon$ error. Crucially, these complexities are novel since they are void of algorithm-dependent parameters seen in prior works, which may be arbitrarily large. The methods are also simple to implement because they are parameter-free and do not directly estimate the unknown parameters. These feats are achieved by new algorithmic innovations for RL, including a dynamic mixing time, a discounted state distribution for sampling, a simple robust gradient estimator, and a recent advantage gap function to certify convergence.

<summary><strong>Networked Restless Multi-Arm Bandits with Reinforcement Learning</strong> - Hanmo Zhang, Zenghui Sun, Kai Wang - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.06274)</summary>

**Abstract:** Restless Multi-Armed Bandits (RMABs) are a powerful framework for sequential decision-making, widely applied in resource allocation and intervention optimization challenges in public health. However, traditional RMABs assume independence among arms, limiting their ability to account for interactions between individuals that can be common and significant in a real-world environment. This paper introduces Networked RMAB, a novel framework that integrates the RMAB model with the independent cascade model to capture interactions between arms in networked environments. We define the Bellman equation for networked RMAB and present its computational challenge due to exponentially large action and state spaces. To resolve the computational challenge, we establish the submodularity of Bellman equation and apply the hill-climbing algorithm to achieve a $1-\frac{1}{e}$ approximation guarantee in Bellman updates. Lastly, we prove that the approximate Bellman updates are guaranteed to converge by a modified contraction analysis. We experimentally verify these results by developing an efficient Q-learning algorithm tailored to the networked setting. Experimental results on real-world graph data demonstrate that our Q-learning approach outperforms both $k$-step look-ahead and network-blind approaches, highlighting the importance of capturing and leveraging network effects where they exist.

**Abstract:** Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as the de-facto paradigm for improving the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). We have developed RLAX, a scalable RL framework on TPUs. RLAX employs a parameter-server architecture. A master trainer periodically pushes updated model weights to the parameter server while a fleet of inference workers pull the latest weights and generates new rollouts. We introduce a suite of system techniques to enable scalable and preemptible RL for a diverse set of state-of-art RL algorithms. To accelerate convergence and improve model quality, we have devised new dataset curation and alignment techniques. Large-scale evaluations show that RLAX improves QwQ-32B's pass@8 accuracy by 12.8% in just 12 hours 48 minutes on 1024 v5p TPUs, while remaining robust to preemptions during training.

<summary><strong>Why Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning Works: Relation to Dual Control</strong> - Nathan P. Lawrence, Ali Mesbah - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.06471)</summary>

**Abstract:** Goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (RL) concerns the problem of training an agent to maximize the probability of reaching target goal states. This paper presents an analysis of the goal-conditioned setting based on optimal control. In particular, we derive an optimality gap between more classical, often quadratic, objectives and the goal-conditioned reward, elucidating the success of goal-conditioned RL and why classical ``dense'' rewards can falter. We then consider the partially observed Markov decision setting and connect state estimation to our probabilistic reward, further making the goal-conditioned reward well suited to dual control problems. The advantages of goal-conditioned policies are validated on nonlinear and uncertain environments using both RL and predictive control techniques.

<summary><strong>Beyond Token-level Supervision: Unlocking the Potential of Decoding-based Regression via Reinforcement Learning</strong> - Ming Chen, Sheng Tang, Rong-Xi Tan, Ziniu Li, Jiacheng Chen, Ke Xue, Chao Qian - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.06533)</summary>

**Abstract:** Decoding-based regression, which reformulates regression as a sequence generation task, has emerged as a promising paradigm of applying large language models for numerical prediction. However, its progress is hindered by the misalignment between discrete token-level objectives (e.g., cross-entropy) and continuous numerical values. Existing approaches relying on token-level constraints often fail to capture the global magnitude of the target value, limiting their precision and generalization. In this paper, we propose to unlock the potential of decoding-based regression via Reinforcement Learning (RL). We formulate the generation process as a Markov Decision Process, utilizing sequence-level rewards to enforce global numerical coherence. Extensive experiments on tabular regression and code metric regression demonstrate that our method (specifically with ReMax and GRPO) consistently outperforms both state-of-the-art token-level baselines and traditional regression heads, showing the superiority of introducing sequence-level signals. Our analysis further reveals that RL significantly enhances sampling efficiency and predictive precision, establishing decoding-based regression as a robust and accurate paradigm for general-purpose numerical prediction.

<summary><strong>ChargingBoul: A Competitive Negotiating Agent with Novel Opponent Modeling</strong> - Joe Shymanski - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.06595)</summary>

**Abstract:** Automated negotiation has emerged as a critical area of research in multiagent systems, with applications spanning e-commerce, resource allocation, and autonomous decision-making. This paper presents ChargingBoul, a negotiating agent that competed in the 2022 Automated Negotiating Agents Competition (ANAC) and placed second in individual utility by an exceptionally narrow margin. ChargingBoul employs a lightweight yet effective strategy that balances concession and opponent modeling to achieve high negotiation outcomes. The agent classifies opponents based on bid patterns, dynamically adjusts its bidding strategy, and applies a concession policy in later negotiation stages to maximize utility while fostering agreements. We evaluate ChargingBoul's performance using competition results and subsequent studies that have utilized the agent in negotiation research. Our analysis highlights ChargingBoul's effectiveness across diverse opponent strategies and its contributions to advancing automated negotiation techniques. We also discuss potential enhancements, including more sophisticated opponent modeling and adaptive bidding heuristics, to improve its performance further.

<summary><strong>Deep Reinforcement Learning for Phishing Detection with Transformer-Based Semantic Features</strong> - Aseer Al Faisal - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.06925)</summary>

**Abstract:** Phishing is a cybercrime in which individuals are deceived into revealing personal information, often resulting in financial loss. These attacks commonly occur through fraudulent messages, misleading advertisements, and compromised legitimate websites. This study proposes a Quantile Regression Deep Q-Network (QR-DQN) approach that integrates RoBERTa semantic embeddings with handcrafted lexical features to enhance phishing detection while accounting for uncertainties. Unlike traditional DQN methods that estimate single scalar Q-values, QR-DQN leverages quantile regression to model the distribution of returns, improving stability and generalization on unseen phishing data. A diverse dataset of 105,000 URLs was curated from PhishTank, OpenPhish, Cloudflare, and other sources, and the model was evaluated using an 80/20 train-test split. The QR-DQN framework achieved a test accuracy of 99.86%, precision of 99.75%, recall of 99.96%, and F1-score of 99.85%, demonstrating high effectiveness. Compared to standard DQN with lexical features, the hybrid QR-DQN with lexical and semantic features reduced the generalization gap from 1.66% to 0.04%, indicating significant improvement in robustness. Five-fold cross-validation confirmed model reliability, yielding a mean accuracy of 99.90% with a standard deviation of 0.04%. These results suggest that the proposed hybrid approach effectively identifies phishing threats, adapts to evolving attack strategies, and generalizes well to unseen data.

**Abstract:** Current autonomous driving systems often favor end-to-end frameworks, which take sensor inputs like images and learn to map them into trajectory space via neural networks. Previous work has demonstrated that models can achieve better planning performance when provided with a prior distribution of possible trajectories. However, these approaches often overlook two critical aspects: 1) The appropriate trajectory prior can vary significantly across different driving scenarios. 2) Their trajectory evaluation mechanism lacks policy-driven refinement, remaining constrained by the limitations of one-stage supervised training. To address these issues, we explore improvements in two key areas. For problem 1, we employ MoE to apply different trajectory priors tailored to different scenarios. For problem 2, we utilize Reinforcement Learning to fine-tune the trajectory scoring mechanism. Additionally, we integrate models with different perception backbones to enhance perceptual features. Our integrated model achieved a score of 51.08 on the navsim ICCV benchmark, securing third place.

<summary><strong>SINRL: Socially Integrated Navigation with Reinforcement Learning using Spiking Neural Networks</strong> - Florian Tretter, Daniel Flögel, Alexandru Vasilache, Max Grobbel, Jürgen Becker, Sören Hohmann - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07266)</summary>

**Abstract:** Integrating autonomous mobile robots into human environments requires human-like decision-making and energy-efficient, event-based computation. Despite progress, neuromorphic methods are rarely applied to Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) navigation approaches due to unstable training. We address this gap with a hybrid socially integrated DRL actor-critic approach that combines Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) in the actor with Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in the critic and a neuromorphic feature extractor to capture temporal crowd dynamics and human-robot interactions. Our approach enhances social navigation performance and reduces estimated energy consumption by approximately 1.69 orders of magnitude.

<summary><strong>Model-Based Reinforcement Learning Under Confounding</strong> - Nishanth Venkatesh, Andreas A. Malikopoulos - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07528)</summary>

**Abstract:** We investigate model-based reinforcement learning in contextual Markov decision processes (C-MDPs) in which the context is unobserved and induces confounding in the offline dataset. In such settings, conventional model-learning methods are fundamentally inconsistent, as the transition and reward mechanisms generated under a behavioral policy do not correspond to the interventional quantities required for evaluating a state-based policy. To address this issue, we adapt a proximal off-policy evaluation approach that identifies the confounded reward expectation using only observable state-action-reward trajectories under mild invertibility conditions on proxy variables. When combined with a behavior-averaged transition model, this construction yields a surrogate MDP whose Bellman operator is well defined and consistent for state-based policies, and which integrates seamlessly with the maximum causal entropy (MaxCausalEnt) model-learning framework. The proposed formulation enables principled model learning and planning in confounded environments where contextual information is unobserved, unavailable, or impractical to collect.

<summary><strong>An AI-Powered Autonomous Underwater System for Sea Exploration and Scientific Research</strong> - Hamad Almazrouei, Mariam Al Nasseri, Maha Alzaabi - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07652)</summary>

**Abstract:** Traditional sea exploration faces significant challenges due to extreme conditions, limited visibility, and high costs, resulting in vast unexplored ocean regions. This paper presents an innovative AI-powered Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) system designed to overcome these limitations by automating underwater object detection, analysis, and reporting. The system integrates YOLOv12 Nano for real-time object detection, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) (ResNet50) for feature extraction, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, and K-Means++ clustering for grouping marine objects based on visual characteristics. Furthermore, a Large Language Model (LLM) (GPT-4o Mini) is employed to generate structured reports and summaries of underwater findings, enhancing data interpretation. The system was trained and evaluated on a combined dataset of over 55,000 images from the DeepFish and OzFish datasets, capturing diverse Australian marine environments. Experimental results demonstrate the system's capability to detect marine objects with a mAP@0.5 of 0.512, a precision of 0.535, and a recall of 0.438. The integration of PCA effectively reduced feature dimensionality while preserving 98% variance, facilitating K-Means clustering which successfully grouped detected objects based on visual similarities. The LLM integration proved effective in generating insightful summaries of detections and clusters, supported by location data. This integrated approach significantly reduces the risks associated with human diving, increases mission efficiency, and enhances the speed and depth of underwater data analysis, paving the way for more effective scientific research and discovery in challenging marine environments.

<summary><strong>Learn the Ropes, Then Trust the Wins: Self-imitation with Progressive Exploration for Agentic Reinforcement Learning</strong> - Yulei Qin, Xiaoyu Tan, Zhengbao He, Gang Li, Haojia Lin, Zongyi Li, Zihan Xu, Yuchen Shi, Siqi Cai, Renting Rui, Shaofei Cai, Yuzheng Cai, Xuan Zhang, Sheng Ye, Ke Li, Xing Sun - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.22601)</summary>

**Abstract:** Reinforcement learning (RL) is the dominant paradigm for sharpening strategic tool use capabilities of LLMs on long-horizon, sparsely-rewarded agent tasks, yet it faces a fundamental challenge of exploration-exploitation trade-off. Existing studies stimulate exploration through the lens of policy entropy, but such mechanical entropy maximization is prone to RL instability due to the multi-turn distribution shifting. In this paper, we target the progressive exploration-exploitation balance under the guidance of the agent's own experiences without succumbing to either entropy collapsing or runaway divergence. We propose SPEAR, a self-imitation learning (SIL) recipe for training agentic LLMs. It extends the vanilla SIL, where a replay buffer stores good experience for off-policy update, by gradually steering the policy entropy across stages. Specifically, the proposed curriculum scheduling harmonizes intrinsic reward shaping and self-imitation to 1) expedite exploration via frequent tool interactions at the beginning, and 2) strengthen exploitation of successful tactics upon convergence towards familiarity with the environment. We also combine bag-of-tricks of industrial RL optimizations for a strong baseline this http URL to demonstrate our effectiveness. In ALFWorld and WebShop, SPEAR increases the success rates of GRPO/GiGPO/Dr.BoT by up to 16.1%/5.1%/8.6% and 20.7%/11.8%/13.9%, respectively. In AIME24 and AIME25, SPEAR boosts this http URL by up to 3.8% and 6.1%, respectively. Such gains incur only 10%-25% extra theoretical complexity and negligible runtime overhead in practice, demonstrating the plug-and-play scalability of SPEAR.

<summary><strong>Native Parallel Reasoner: Reasoning in Parallelism via Self-Distilled Reinforcement Learning</strong> - Tong Wu, Yang Liu, Jun Bai, Zixia Jia, Shuyi Zhang, Ziyong Lin, Yanting Wang, Song-Chun Zhu, Zilong Zheng - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07461)</summary>

**Abstract:** We introduce Native Parallel Reasoner (NPR), a teacher-free framework that enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to self-evolve genuine parallel reasoning capabilities. NPR transforms the model from sequential emulation to native parallel cognition through three key innovations: 1) a self-distilled progressive training paradigm that transitions from ``cold-start'' format discovery to strict topological constraints without external supervision; 2) a novel Parallel-Aware Policy Optimization (PAPO) algorithm that optimizes branching policies directly within the execution graph, allowing the model to learn adaptive decomposition via trial and error; and 3) a robust NPR Engine that refactors memory management and flow control of SGLang to enable stable, large-scale parallel RL training. Across eight reasoning benchmarks, NPR trained on Qwen3-4B achieves performance gains of up to 24.5% and inference speedups up to 4.6x. Unlike prior baselines that often fall back to autoregressive decoding, NPR demonstrates 100% genuine parallel execution, establishing a new standard for self-evolving, efficient, and scalable agentic reasoning.

<summary><strong>Enhancing Agentic RL with Progressive Reward Shaping and Value-based Sampling Policy Optimization</strong> - Zhuoran Zhuang, Ye Chen, Jianghao Su, Chao Luo, Luhui Liu, Xia Zeng - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07478)</summary>

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) empowered with Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) can iteratively plan, call external tools, and integrate returned information to solve complex, long-horizon reasoning tasks. Agentic Reinforcement Learning (Agentic RL) optimizes such models over full tool-interaction trajectories, but two key challenges hinder effectiveness: (1) Sparse, non-instructive rewards, such as binary 0-1 verifiable signals, provide limited guidance for intermediate steps and slow convergence; (2) Gradient degradation in Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), where identical rewards within a rollout group yield zero advantage, reducing sample efficiency and destabilizing training. To address these challenges, we propose two complementary techniques: Progressive Reward Shaping (PRS) and Value-based Sampling Policy Optimization (VSPO). PRS is a curriculum-inspired reward design that introduces dense, stage-wise feedback - encouraging models to first master parseable and properly formatted tool calls, then optimize for factual correctness and answer quality. We instantiate PRS for short-form QA (with a length-aware BLEU to fairly score concise answers) and long-form QA (with LLM-as-a-Judge scoring to prevent reward hacking). VSPO is an enhanced GRPO variant that replaces low-value samples with prompts selected by a task-value metric balancing difficulty and uncertainty, and applies value-smoothing clipping to stabilize gradient updates. Experiments on multiple short-form and long-form QA benchmarks show that PRS consistently outperforms traditional binary rewards, and VSPO achieves superior stability, faster convergence, and higher final performance compared to PPO, GRPO, CISPO, and SFT-only baselines. Together, PRS and VSPO yield LLM-based TIR agents that generalize better across domains.

**Abstract:** This paper presents \textsc{Luca}, a \underline{l}arge language model (LLM)-\underline{u}pgraded graph reinforcement learning framework for \underline{c}arbon-\underline{a}ware flexible job shop scheduling. \textsc{Luca} addresses the challenges of dynamic and sustainable scheduling in smart manufacturing systems by integrating a graph neural network and an LLM, guided by a carefully designed in-house prompting strategy, to produce a fused embedding that captures both structural characteristics and contextual semantics of the latest scheduling state. This expressive embedding is then processed by a deep reinforcement learning policy network, which generates real-time scheduling decisions optimized for both makespan and carbon emission objectives. To support sustainability goals, \textsc{Luca} incorporates a dual-objective reward function that encourages both energy efficiency and scheduling timeliness. Experimental results on both synthetic and public datasets demonstrate that \textsc{Luca} consistently outperforms comparison algorithms. For instance, on the synthetic dataset, it achieves an average of 4.1\% and up to 12.2\% lower makespan compared to the best-performing comparison algorithm while maintaining the same emission level. On public datasets, additional gains are observed for both makespan and emission. These results demonstrate that \textsc{Luca} is effective and practical for carbon-aware scheduling in smart manufacturing.

<summary><strong>MMDuet2: Enhancing Proactive Interaction of Video MLLMs with Multi-Turn Reinforcement Learning</strong> - Yueqian Wang, Songxiang Liu, Disong Wang, Nuo Xu, Guanglu Wan, Huishuai Zhang, Dongyan Zhao - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.06810)</summary>

**Abstract:** Recent advances in video multimodal large language models (Video MLLMs) have significantly enhanced video understanding and multi-modal interaction capabilities. While most existing systems operate in a turn-based manner where the model can only reply after user turns, proactively deciding when to reply during video playback presents a promising yet challenging direction for real-time applications. In this work, we propose a novel text-to-text approach to proactive interaction, where the model autonomously determines whether to respond or remain silent at each turn based on dialogue history and visual context up to current frame of an streaming video. To overcome difficulties in previous methods such as manually tuning response decision thresholds and annotating precise reply times, we introduce a multi-turn RL based training method that encourages timely and accurate responses without requiring precise response time annotations. We train our model MMDuet2 on a dataset of 52k videos with two types of dialogues via SFT and RL. Experimental results demonstrate that MMDuet2 outperforms existing proactive Video MLLM baselines in response timing and quality, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the ProactiveVideoQA benchmark.

**Abstract:** Reasoning-focused large language models (LLMs) are rapidly evolving across various domains, yet their capabilities in handling complex legal problems remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce Unilaw-R1, a large language model tailored for legal reasoning. With a lightweight 7-billion parameter scale, Unilaw-R1 significantly reduces deployment cost while effectively tackling three core challenges in the legal domain: insufficient legal knowledge, unreliable reasoning logic, and weak business generalization. To address these issues, we first construct Unilaw-R1-Data, a high-quality dataset containing 17K distilled and screened chain-of-thought (CoT) samples. Based on this, we adopt a two-stage training strategy combining Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL), which significantly boosts the performance on complex legal reasoning tasks and supports interpretable decision-making in legal AI applications. To assess legal reasoning ability, we also introduce Unilaw-R1-Eval, a dedicated benchmark designed to evaluate models across single- and multi-choice legal tasks. Unilaw-R1 demonstrates strong results on authoritative benchmarks, outperforming all models of similar scale and achieving performance on par with the much larger DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B (54.9%). Following domain-specific training, it also showed significant gains on LawBench and LexEval, exceeding Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct (46.6%) by an average margin of 6.6%.

<summary><strong>Aligning Machiavellian Agents: Behavior Steering via Test-Time Policy Shaping</strong> - Dena Mujtaba, Brian Hu, Anthony Hoogs, Arslan Basharat - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.11551)</summary>

**Abstract:** The deployment of decision-making AI agents presents a critical challenge in maintaining alignment with human values or guidelines while operating in complex, dynamic environments. Agents trained solely to achieve their objectives may adopt harmful behavior, exposing a key trade-off between maximizing the reward function and maintaining alignment. For pre-trained agents, ensuring alignment is particularly challenging, as retraining can be a costly and slow process. This is further complicated by the diverse and potentially conflicting attributes representing the ethical values for alignment. To address these challenges, we propose a test-time alignment technique based on model-guided policy shaping. Our method allows precise control over individual behavioral attributes, generalizes across diverse reinforcement learning (RL) environments, and facilitates a principled trade-off between ethical alignment and reward maximization without requiring agent retraining. We evaluate our approach using the MACHIAVELLI benchmark, which comprises 134 text-based game environments and thousands of annotated scenarios involving ethical decisions. The RL agents are first trained to maximize the reward in their respective games. At test time, we apply policy shaping via scenario-action attribute classifiers to ensure decision alignment with ethical attributes. We compare our approach against prior training-time methods and general-purpose agents, as well as study several types of ethical violations and power-seeking behavior. Our results demonstrate that test-time policy shaping provides an effective and scalable solution for mitigating unethical behavior across diverse environments and alignment attributes.

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have fundamentally transformed automated software development by enabling direct translation of natural language descriptions into functional code, driving commercial adoption through tools like Github Copilot (Microsoft), Cursor (Anysphere), Trae (ByteDance), and Claude Code (Anthropic). While the field has evolved dramatically from rule-based systems to Transformer-based architectures, achieving performance improvements from single-digit to over 95\% success rates on benchmarks like HumanEval. In this work, we provide a comprehensive synthesis and practical guide (a series of analytic and probing experiments) about code LLMs, systematically examining the complete model life cycle from data curation to post-training through advanced prompting paradigms, code pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and autonomous coding agents. We analyze the code capability of the general LLMs (GPT-4, Claude, LLaMA) and code-specialized LLMs (StarCoder, Code LLaMA, DeepSeek-Coder, and QwenCoder), critically examining the techniques, design decisions, and trade-offs. Further, we articulate the research-practice gap between academic research (e.g., benchmarks and tasks) and real-world deployment (e.g., software-related code tasks), including code correctness, security, contextual awareness of large codebases, and integration with development workflows, and map promising research directions to practical needs. Last, we conduct a series of experiments to provide a comprehensive analysis of code pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning, covering scaling law, framework selection, hyperparameter sensitivity, model architectures, and dataset comparisons.

<summary><strong>Average-reward reinforcement learning in semi-Markov decision processes via relative value iteration</strong> - Huizhen Yu, Yi Wan, Richard S. Sutton - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.06218)</summary>

**Abstract:** This paper applies the authors' recent results on asynchronous stochastic approximation (SA) in the Borkar-Meyn framework to reinforcement learning in average-reward semi-Markov decision processes (SMDPs). We establish the convergence of an asynchronous SA analogue of Schweitzer's classical relative value iteration algorithm, RVI Q-learning, for finite-space, weakly communicating SMDPs. In particular, we show that the algorithm converges almost surely to a compact, connected subset of solutions to the average-reward optimality equation, with convergence to a unique, sample path-dependent solution under additional stepsize and asynchrony conditions. Moreover, to make full use of the SA framework, we introduce new monotonicity conditions for estimating the optimal reward rate in RVI Q-learning. These conditions substantially expand the previously considered algorithmic framework and are addressed through novel arguments in the stability and convergence analysis of RVI Q-learning.

<summary><strong>Parent-Guided Semantic Reward Model (PGSRM): Embedding-Based Reward Functions for Reinforcement Learning of Transformer Language Models</strong> - Alexandr Plashchinsky - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.06920)</summary>

**Abstract:** We introduce the Parent-Guided Semantic Reward Model (PGSRM), a lightweight reward framework for reinforcement learning (RL) of transformer language models. PGSRM replaces binary correctness signals, human preference data, and trained reward models with a simple signal: cosine similarity between a parent model's reference output embedding and a child model's generated output for the same input. This yields a dense, semantically meaningful reward with no human annotation or additional model training. We apply PGSRM on five language tasks and find that it produces smoother reward improvement and more stable PPO dynamics than a binary reward baseline, suggesting that embedding-based semantic rewards are a practical alternative to RLHF-style reward modeling for parent-guided alignment in smaller transformer models.

<summary><strong>Statistical analysis of Inverse Entropy-regularized Reinforcement Learning</strong> - Denis Belomestny, Alexey Naumov, Sergey Samsonov - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.06956)</summary>

**Abstract:** Inverse reinforcement learning aims to infer the reward function that explains expert behavior observed through trajectories of state--action pairs. A long-standing difficulty in classical IRL is the non-uniqueness of the recovered reward: many reward functions can induce the same optimal policy, rendering the inverse problem ill-posed. In this paper, we develop a statistical framework for Inverse Entropy-regularized Reinforcement Learning that resolves this ambiguity by combining entropy regularization with a least-squares reconstruction of the reward from the soft Bellman residual. This combination yields a unique and well-defined so-called least-squares reward consistent with the expert policy. We model the expert demonstrations as a Markov chain with the invariant distribution defined by an unknown expert policy $\pi^\star$ and estimate the policy by a penalized maximum-likelihood procedure over a class of conditional distributions on the action space. We establish high-probability bounds for the excess Kullback--Leibler divergence between the estimated policy and the expert policy, accounting for statistical complexity through covering numbers of the policy class. These results lead to non-asymptotic minimax optimal convergence rates for the least-squares reward function, revealing the interplay between smoothing (entropy regularization), model complexity, and sample size. Our analysis bridges the gap between behavior cloning, inverse reinforcement learning, and modern statistical learning theory.

<summary><strong>PrivORL: Differentially Private Synthetic Dataset for Offline Reinforcement Learning</strong> - Chen Gong, Zheng Liu, Kecen Li, Tianhao Wang - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07342)</summary>

**Abstract:** Recently, offline reinforcement learning (RL) has become a popular RL paradigm. In offline RL, data providers share pre-collected datasets -- either as individual transitions or sequences of transitions forming trajectories -- to enable the training of RL models (also called agents) without direct interaction with the environments. Offline RL saves interactions with environments compared to traditional RL, and has been effective in critical areas, such as navigation tasks. Meanwhile, concerns about privacy leakage from offline RL datasets have emerged.
To safeguard private information in offline RL datasets, we propose the first differential privacy (DP) offline dataset synthesis method, PrivORL, which leverages a diffusion model and diffusion transformer to synthesize transitions and trajectories, respectively, under DP. The synthetic dataset can then be securely released for downstream analysis and research. PrivORL adopts the popular approach of pre-training a synthesizer on public datasets, and then fine-tuning on sensitive datasets using DP Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD). Additionally, PrivORL introduces curiosity-driven pre-training, which uses feedback from the curiosity module to diversify the synthetic dataset and thus can generate diverse synthetic transitions and trajectories that closely resemble the sensitive dataset. Extensive experiments on five sensitive offline RL datasets show that our method achieves better utility and fidelity in both DP transition and trajectory synthesis compared to baselines. The replication package is available at the GitHub repository.

<summary><strong>Entropy-Controlled Intrinsic Motivation Reinforcement Learning for Quadruped Robot Locomotion in Complex Terrains</strong> - Wanru Gong, Xinyi Zheng, Xiaopeng Yang, Xiaoqing Zhu - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.06486)</summary>

**Abstract:** Learning is the basis of both biological and artificial systems when it comes to mimicking intelligent behaviors. From the classical PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization), there is a series of deep reinforcement learning algorithms which are widely used in training locomotion policies for quadrupedal robots because of their stability and sample efficiency. However, among all these variants, experiments and simulations often converge prematurely, leading to suboptimal locomotion and reduced task performance. Therefore, in this paper, we introduce Entropy-Controlled Intrinsic Motivation (ECIM), an entropy-based reinforcement learning algorithm in contrast with the PPO series, that can reduce premature convergence by combining intrinsic motivation with adaptive exploration.
For experiments, in order to parallel with other baselines, we chose to apply it in Isaac Gym across six terrain categories: upward slopes, downward slopes, uneven rough terrain, ascending stairs, descending stairs, and flat ground as widely used. For comparison, our experiments consistently achieve better performance: task rewards increase by 4--12%, peak body pitch oscillation is reduced by 23--29%, joint acceleration decreases by 20--32%, and joint torque consumption declines by 11--20%. Overall, our model ECIM, by combining entropy control and intrinsic motivation control, achieves better results in stability across different terrains for quadrupedal locomotion, and at the same time reduces energetic cost and makes it a practical choice for complex robotic control tasks.

**Abstract:** The rapid development of autonomous vehicles has led to a surge in testing demand. Traditional testing methods, such as virtual simulation, closed-course, and public road testing, face several challenges, including unrealistic vehicle states, limited testing capabilities, and high costs. These issues have prompted increasing interest in virtual-physical fusion testing. However, despite its potential, virtual-physical fusion testing still faces challenges, such as limited element types, narrow testing scope, and fixed evaluation metrics. To address these challenges, we propose the Virtual-Physical Testing Platform for Autonomous Vehicles (VP-AutoTest), which integrates over ten types of virtual and physical elements, including vehicles, pedestrians, and roadside infrastructure, to replicate the diversity of real-world traffic participants. The platform also supports both single-vehicle interaction and multi-vehicle cooperation testing, employing adversarial testing and parallel deduction to accelerate fault detection and explore algorithmic limits, while OBU and Redis communication enable seamless vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) cooperation across all levels of cooperative automation. Furthermore, VP-AutoTest incorporates a multidimensional evaluation framework and AI-driven expert systems to conduct comprehensive performance assessment and defect diagnosis. Finally, by comparing virtual-physical fusion test results with real-world experiments, the platform performs credibility self-evaluation to ensure both the fidelity and efficiency of autonomous driving testing.

**Abstract:** Scientific embodied agents play a crucial role in modern laboratories by automating complex experimental workflows. Compared to typical household environments, laboratory settings impose significantly higher demands on perception of physical-chemical transformations and long-horizon planning, making them an ideal testbed for advancing embodied intelligence. However, its development has been long hampered by the lack of suitable simulator and benchmarks. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing LabUtopia, a comprehensive simulation and benchmarking suite designed to facilitate the development of generalizable, reasoning-capable embodied agents in laboratory settings. Specifically, it integrates i) LabSim, a high-fidelity simulator supporting multi-physics and chemically meaningful interactions; ii) LabScene, a scalable procedural generator for diverse scientific scenes; and iii) LabBench, a hierarchical benchmark spanning five levels of complexity from atomic actions to long-horizon mobile manipulation. LabUtopia supports 30 distinct tasks and includes more than 200 scene and instrument assets, enabling large-scale training and principled evaluation in high-complexity environments. We demonstrate that LabUtopia offers a powerful platform for advancing the integration of perception, planning, and control in scientific-purpose agents and provides a rigorous testbed for exploring the practical capabilities and generalization limits of embodied intelligence in future research.

<summary><strong>SIGN: Safety-Aware Image-Goal Navigation for Autonomous Drones via Reinforcement Learning</strong> - Zichen Yan, Rui Huang, Lei He, Shao Guo, Lin Zhao - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.12394)</summary>

**Abstract:** Image-goal navigation (ImageNav) tasks a robot with autonomously exploring an unknown environment and reaching a location that visually matches a given target image. While prior works primarily study ImageNav for ground robots, enabling this capability for autonomous drones is substantially more challenging due to their need for high-frequency feedback control and global localization for stable flight. In this paper, we propose a novel sim-to-real framework that leverages reinforcement learning (RL) to achieve ImageNav for drones. To enhance visual representation ability, our approach trains the vision backbone with auxiliary tasks, including image perturbations and future transition prediction, which results in more effective policy training. The proposed algorithm enables end-to-end ImageNav with direct velocity control, eliminating the need for external localization. Furthermore, we integrate a depth-based safety module for real-time obstacle avoidance, allowing the drone to safely navigate in cluttered environments. Unlike most existing drone navigation methods that focus solely on reference tracking or obstacle avoidance, our framework supports comprehensive navigation behaviors, including autonomous exploration, obstacle avoidance, and image-goal seeking, without requiring explicit global mapping.

**Abstract:** Embodied agents face a fundamental limitation: once deployed in real-world environments to perform specific tasks, they are unable to acquire additional knowledge to enhance task performance. In this paper, we propose a general post-deployment learning framework Dejavu, which employs an Experience Feedback Network (EFN) and augments the frozen Vision-Language-Action (VLA) policy with retrieved execution memories. EFN identifies contextually prior action experiences and conditions action prediction on this retrieved guidance. We adopt reinforcement learning with semantic similarity rewards to train EFN, ensuring that the predicted actions align with past behaviors under current observations. During deployment, EFN continually enriches its memory with new trajectories, enabling the agent to exhibit "learning from experience". Experiments across diverse embodied tasks show that EFN improves adaptability, robustness, and success rates over frozen baselines. We provide code and demo in our supplementary material.

<summary><strong>Pretraining in Actor-Critic Reinforcement Learning for Robot Locomotion</strong> - Jiale Fan, Andrei Cramariuc, Tifanny Portela, Marco Hutter - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12363)</summary>

**Abstract:** The pretraining-finetuning paradigm has facilitated numerous transformative advancements in artificial intelligence research in recent years. However, in the domain of reinforcement learning (RL) for robot locomotion, individual skills are often learned from scratch despite the high likelihood that some generalizable knowledge is shared across all task-specific policies belonging to the same robot embodiment. This work aims to define a paradigm for pretraining neural network models that encapsulate such knowledge and can subsequently serve as a basis for warm-starting the RL process in classic actor-critic algorithms, such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). We begin with a task-agnostic exploration-based data collection algorithm to gather diverse, dynamic transition data, which is then used to train a Proprioceptive Inverse Dynamics Model (PIDM) through supervised learning. The pretrained weights are then loaded into both the actor and critic networks to warm-start the policy optimization of actual tasks. We systematically validated our proposed method with 9 distinct robot locomotion RL environments comprising 3 different robot embodiments, showing significant benefits of this initialization strategy. Our proposed approach on average improves sample efficiency by 36.9% and task performance by 7.3% compared to random initialization. We further present key ablation studies and empirical analyses that shed light on the mechanisms behind the effectiveness of this method.

<summary><strong>Certifying Stability of Reinforcement Learning Policies using Generalized Lyapunov Functions</strong> - Kehan Long, Jorge Cortés, Nikolay Atanasov - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.10947)</summary>

**Abstract:** Establishing stability certificates for closed-loop systems under reinforcement learning (RL) policies is essential to move beyond empirical performance and offer guarantees of system behavior. Classical Lyapunov methods require a strict stepwise decrease in the Lyapunov function but such certificates are difficult to construct for learned policies. The RL value function is a natural candidate but it is not well understood how it can be adapted for this purpose. To gain intuition, we first study the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problem and make two key observations. First, a Lyapunov function can be obtained from the value function of an LQR policy by augmenting it with a residual term related to the system dynamics and stage cost. Second, the classical Lyapunov decrease requirement can be relaxed to a generalized Lyapunov condition requiring only decrease on average over multiple time steps. Using this intuition, we consider the nonlinear setting and formulate an approach to learn generalized Lyapunov functions by augmenting RL value functions with neural network residual terms. Our approach successfully certifies the stability of RL policies trained on Gymnasium and DeepMind Control benchmarks. We also extend our method to jointly train neural controllers and stability certificates using a multi-step Lyapunov loss, resulting in larger certified inner approximations of the region of attraction compared to the classical Lyapunov approach. Overall, our formulation enables stability certification for a broad class of systems with learned policies by making certificates easier to construct, thereby bridging classical control theory and modern learning-based methods.

<summary><strong>Safety-Aware Reinforcement Learning for Control via Risk-Sensitive Action-Value Iteration and Quantile Regression</strong> - Clinton Enwerem, Aniruddh G. Puranic, John S. Baras, Calin Belta - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.06954)</summary>

**Abstract:** Mainstream approximate action-value iteration reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms suffer from overestimation bias, leading to suboptimal policies in high-variance stochastic environments. Quantile-based action-value iteration methods reduce this bias by learning a distribution of the expected cost-to-go using quantile regression. However, ensuring that the learned policy satisfies safety constraints remains a challenge when these constraints are not explicitly integrated into the RL framework. Existing methods often require complex neural architectures or manual tradeoffs due to combined cost functions. To address this, we propose a risk-regularized quantile-based algorithm integrating Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) to enforce safety without complex architectures. We also provide theoretical guarantees on the contraction properties of the risk-sensitive distributional Bellman operator in Wasserstein space, ensuring convergence to a unique cost distribution. Simulations of a mobile robot in a dynamic reach-avoid task show that our approach leads to more goal successes, fewer collisions, and better safety-performance trade-offs than risk-neutral methods.

<summary><strong>ATOD: An Evaluation Framework and Benchmark for Agentic Task-Oriented Dialogue System</strong> - Yifei Zhang, Hooshang Nayyeri, Rinat Khaziev, Emine Yilmaz, Gokhan Tur, Dilek Hakkani-Tür, Hari Thadakamalla - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.11854)</summary>

**Abstract:** Recent advances in task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems, driven by large language models (LLMs) with extensive API and tool integration, have enabled conversational agents to coordinate interleaved goals, maintain long-horizon context, and act proactively through asynchronous execution. These capabilities extend beyond traditional TOD systems, yet existing benchmarks lack systematic support for evaluating such agentic behaviors. To address this gap, we introduce ATOD, a benchmark and synthetic dialogue generation pipeline that produces richly annotated conversations requiring long-term reasoning. ATOD captures key characteristics of advanced TOD, including multi-goal coordination, dependency management, memory, adaptability, and proactivity. Building on ATOD, we propose ATOD-Eval, a holistic evaluation framework that translates these dimensions into fine-grained metrics and supports reproducible offline and online evaluation. We further present a strong agentic memory-based evaluator for benchmarking on ATOD. Experiments show that ATOD-Eval enables comprehensive assessment across task completion, agentic capability, and response quality, and that the proposed evaluator offers a better accuracy-efficiency tradeoff compared to existing memory- and LLM-based approaches under this evaluation setting.

<summary><strong>AgenTRIM: Tool Risk Mitigation for Agentic AI</strong> - Roy Betser, Shamik Bose, Amit Giloni, Chiara Picardi, Sindhu Padakandla, Roman Vainshtein - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.12449)</summary>

**Abstract:** AI agents are autonomous systems that combine LLMs with external tools to solve complex tasks. While such tools extend capability, improper tool permissions introduce security risks such as indirect prompt injection and tool misuse. We characterize these failures as unbalanced tool-driven agency. Agents may retain unnecessary permissions (excessive agency) or fail to invoke required tools (insufficient agency), amplifying the attack surface and reducing performance. We introduce AgenTRIM, a framework for detecting and mitigating tool-driven agency risks without altering an agent's internal reasoning. AgenTRIM addresses these risks through complementary offline and online phases. Offline, AgenTRIM reconstructs and verifies the agent's tool interface from code and execution traces. At runtime, it enforces per-step least-privilege tool access through adaptive filtering and status-aware validation of tool calls. Evaluating on the AgentDojo benchmark, AgenTRIM substantially reduces attack success while maintaining high task performance. Additional experiments show robustness to description-based attacks and effective enforcement of explicit safety policies. Together, these results demonstrate that AgenTRIM provides a practical, capability-preserving approach to safer tool use in LLM-based agents.

<summary><strong>Agentic Conversational Search with Contextualized Reasoning via Reinforcement Learning</strong> - Fengran Mo, Yifan Gao, Sha Li, Hansi Zeng, Xin Liu, Zhaoxuan Tan, Xian Li, Jianshu Chen, Dakuo Wang, Meng Jiang - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.13115)</summary>

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a popular interface for human-AI interaction, supporting information seeking and task assistance through natural, multi-turn dialogue. To respond to users within multi-turn dialogues, the context-dependent user intent evolves across interactions, requiring contextual interpretation, query reformulation, and dynamic coordination between retrieval and generation. Existing studies usually follow static rewrite, retrieve, and generate pipelines, which optimize different procedures separately and overlook the mixed-initiative action optimization simultaneously. Although the recent developments in deep search agents demonstrate the effectiveness in jointly optimizing retrieval and generation via reasoning, these approaches focus on single-turn scenarios, which might lack the ability to handle multi-turn interactions. We introduce a conversational agent that interleaves search and reasoning across turns, enabling exploratory and adaptive behaviors learned through reinforcement learning (RL) training with tailored rewards towards evolving user goals. The experimental results across four widely used conversational benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods by surpassing several existing strong baselines.

<summary><strong>PhysicsSolutionAgent: Towards Multimodal Explanations for Numerical Physics Problem Solving</strong> - Aditya Thole, Anmol Agrawal, Arnav Ramamoorthy, Dhruv Kumar - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.13453)</summary>

**Abstract:** Explaining numerical physics problems often requires more than text-based solutions; clear visual reasoning can substantially improve conceptual understanding. While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance on many physics questions in textual form, their ability to generate long, high-quality visual explanations remains insufficiently explored. In this work, we introduce PhysicsSolutionAgent (PSA), an autonomous agent that generates physics-problem explanation videos of up to six minutes using Manim animations. To evaluate the generated videos, we design an assessment pipeline that performs automated checks across 15 quantitative parameters and incorporates feedback from a vision-language model (VLM) to iteratively improve video quality. We evaluate PSA on 32 videos spanning numerical and theoretical physics problems. Our results reveal systematic differences in video quality depending on problem difficulty and whether the task is numerical or theoretical. Using GPT-5-mini, PSA achieves a 100% video-completion rate with an average automated score of 3.8/5. However, qualitative analysis and human inspection uncover both minor and major issues, including visual layout inconsistencies and errors in how visual content is interpreted during feedback. These findings expose key limitations in reliable Manim code generation and highlight broader challenges in multimodal reasoning and evaluation for visual explanations of numerical physics problems. Our work underscores the need for improved visual understanding, verification, and evaluation frameworks in future multimodal educational systems

<summary><strong>OP-Bench: Benchmarking Over-Personalization for Memory-Augmented Personalized Conversational Agents</strong> - Yulin Hu, Zimo Long, Jiahe Guo, Xingyu Sui, Xing Fu, Weixiang Zhao, Yanyan Zhao, Bing Qin - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.13722)</summary>

**Abstract:** Memory-augmented conversational agents enable personalized interactions using long-term user memory and have gained substantial traction. However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on whether agents can recall and apply user information, while overlooking whether such personalization is used appropriately. In fact, agents may overuse personal information, producing responses that feel forced, intrusive, or socially inappropriate to users. We refer to this issue as \emph{over-personalization}. In this work, we formalize over-personalization into three types: Irrelevance, Repetition, and Sycophancy, and introduce \textbf{OP-Bench} a benchmark of 1,700 verified instances constructed from long-horizon dialogue histories. Using \textbf{OP-Bench}, we evaluate multiple large language models and memory-augmentation methods, and find that over-personalization is widespread when memory is introduced. Further analysis reveals that agents tend to retrieve and over-attend to user memories even when unnecessary. To address this issue, we propose \textbf{Self-ReCheck}, a lightweight, model-agnostic memory filtering mechanism that mitigates over-personalization while preserving personalization performance. Our work takes an initial step toward more controllable and appropriate personalization in memory-augmented dialogue systems.

<summary><strong>PaperGuide: Making Small Language-Model Paper-Reading Agents More Efficient</strong> - Zijian Wang, Tiancheng Huang, Hanqi Li, Da Ma, Lu Chen, Kai Yu - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.12988)</summary>

**Abstract:** The accelerating growth of the scientific literature makes it increasingly difficult for researchers to track new advances through manual reading alone. Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has therefore spurred interest in autonomous agents that can read scientific papers and extract task-relevant information. However, most existing approaches rely either on heavily engineered prompting or on a conventional SFT-RL training pipeline, both of which often lead to excessive and low-yield exploration. Drawing inspiration from cognitive science, we propose PaperCompass, a framework that mitigates these issues by separating high-level planning from fine-grained execution. PaperCompass first drafts an explicit plan that outlines the intended sequence of actions, and then performs detailed reasoning to instantiate each step by selecting the parameters for the corresponding function calls. To train such behavior, we introduce Draft-and-Follow Policy Optimization (DFPO), a tailored RL method that jointly optimizes both the draft plan and the final solution. DFPO can be viewed as a lightweight form of hierarchical reinforcement learning, aimed at narrowing the `knowing-doing' gap in LLMs. We provide a theoretical analysis that establishes DFPO's favorable optimization properties, supporting a stable and reliable training process. Experiments on paper-based question answering (Paper-QA) benchmarks show that PaperCompass improves efficiency over strong baselines without sacrificing performance, achieving results comparable to much larger models.

<summary><strong>Large Multimodal Models for Embodied Intelligent Driving: The Next Frontier in Self-Driving?</strong> - Long Zhang, Yuchen Xia, Bingqing Wei, Zhen Liu, Shiwen Mao, Zhu Han, Mohsen Guizani - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.08434)</summary>

**Abstract:** The advent of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) offers a promising technology to tackle the limitations of modular design in autonomous driving, which often falters in open-world scenarios requiring sustained environmental understanding and logical reasoning. Besides, embodied artificial intelligence facilitates policy optimization through closed-loop interactions to achieve the continuous learning capability, thereby advancing autonomous driving toward embodied intelligent (El) driving. However, such capability will be constrained by relying solely on LMMs to enhance EI driving without joint decision-making. This article introduces a novel semantics and policy dual-driven hybrid decision framework to tackle this challenge, ensuring continuous learning and joint decision. The framework merges LMMs for semantic understanding and cognitive representation, and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for real-time policy optimization. We start by introducing the foundational principles of EI driving and LMMs. Moreover, we examine the emerging opportunities this framework enables, encompassing potential benefits and representative use cases. A case study is conducted experimentally to validate the performance superiority of our framework in completing lane-change planning task. Finally, several future research directions to empower EI driving are identified to guide subsequent work.

<summary><strong>Tube-Based Robust Control Strategy for Vision-Guided Autonomous Vehicles</strong> - Der-Hau Lee - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.18752)</summary>

**Abstract:** A robust control strategy for autonomous vehicles can improve system stability, enhance riding comfort, and prevent driving accidents. This paper presents a novel interpolation-tube-based constrained iterative linear quadratic regulator (itube-CILQR) algorithm for autonomous computer-vision-based vehicle lane-keeping. The goal of the algorithm is to enhance robustness during high-speed cornering on tight turns. Compared with standard tube-based approaches, the proposed itube-CILQR algorithm reduces system conservatism and exhibits higher computational speed. Numerical simulations and vision-based experiments were conducted to examine the feasibility of using the proposed algorithm for controlling autonomous vehicles. The results indicated that the proposed algorithm achieved superior vehicle lane-keeping performance to variational CILQR-based methods and model predictive control (MPC) approaches involving the use of a classical interior-point optimizer. Specifically, itube-CILQR required an average runtime of 3.45 ms to generate a control signal for guiding a self-driving vehicle. By comparison, itube-MPC typically required a 4.32 times longer computation time to complete the same task. Moreover, the influence of conservatism on system behavior was investigated by exploring the variations in the interpolation variables derived using the proposed itube-CILQR algorithm during lane-keeping maneuvers.

<summary><strong>The AI Genie Phenomenon and Three Types of AI Chatbot Addiction: Escapist Roleplays, Pseudosocial Companions, and Epistemic Rabbit Holes</strong> - M. Karen Shen, Jessica Huang, Olivia Liang, Ig-Jae Kim, Dongwook Yoon - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.13348)</summary>

**Abstract:** Recent reports on generative AI chatbot use raise concerns about its addictive potential. An in-depth understanding is imperative to minimize risks, yet AI chatbot addiction remains poorly understood. This study examines how to characterize AI chatbot addiction--why users become addicted, the symptoms commonly reported, and the distinct types it comprises. We conducted a thematic analysis of Reddit entries (n=334) across 14 subreddits where users narrated their experiences with addictive AI chatbot use, followed by an exploratory data analysis. We found: (1) users' dependence tied to the "AI Genie" phenomenon--users can get exactly anything they want with minimal effort--and marked by symptoms that align with addiction literature, (2) three distinct addiction types: Escapist Roleplay, Pseudosocial Companion, and Epistemic Rabbit Hole, (3) sexual content involved in multiple cases, and (4) recovery strategies' perceived helpfulness differ between addiction types. Our work lays empirical groundwork to inform future strategies for prevention, diagnosis, and intervention.

<summary><strong>Conversations over Clicks: Impact of Chatbots on Information Search in Interdisciplinary Learning</strong> - Hannah Kim, Sergei L. Kosakovsky Pond, Stephen MacNeil - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.21490)</summary>

**Abstract:** This full research paper investigates the impact of generative AI (GenAI) on the learner experience, with a focus on how learners engage with and utilize the information it provides. In e-learning environments, learners often need to navigate a complex information space on their own. This challenge is further compounded in interdisciplinary fields like bioinformatics, due to the varied prior knowledge and backgrounds. In this paper, we studied how GenAI influences information search in bioinformatics research: (1) How do interactions with a GenAI chatbot influence learner orienteering behaviors?; and (2) How do learners identify information scent in GenAI chatbot responses? We adopted an autoethnographic approach to investigate these questions. GenAI was found to support orienteering once a learning plan was established, but it was counterproductive prior to that. Moreover, traditionally value-rich information sources such as bullet points and related terms proved less effective when applied to GenAI responses. Information scents were primarily recognized through the presence or absence of prior knowledge of the domain. These findings suggest that GenAI should be adopted into e-learning environments with caution, particularly in interdisciplinary learning contexts.

<summary><strong>ARC: Active and Reflection-driven Context Management for Long-Horizon Information Seeking Agents</strong> - Yilun Yao, Shan Huang, Elsie Dai, Zhewen Tan, Zhenyu Duan, Shousheng Jia, Yanbing Jiang, Tong Yang - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.12030)</summary>

**Abstract:** Large language models are increasingly deployed as research agents for deep search and long-horizon information seeking, yet their performance often degrades as interaction histories grow. This degradation, known as context rot, reflects a failure to maintain coherent and task-relevant internal states over extended reasoning horizons. Existing approaches primarily manage context through raw accumulation or passive summarization, treating it as a static artifact and allowing early errors or misplaced emphasis to persist. Motivated by this perspective, we propose ARC, which is the first framework to systematically formulate context management as an active, reflection-driven process that treats context as a dynamic internal reasoning state during execution. ARC operationalizes this view through reflection-driven monitoring and revision, allowing agents to actively reorganize their working context when misalignment or degradation is detected. Experiments on challenging long-horizon information-seeking benchmarks show that ARC consistently outperforms passive context compression methods, achieving up to an 11% absolute improvement in accuracy on BrowseComp-ZH with Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct.

<summary><strong>ToolPRMBench: Evaluating and Advancing Process Reward Models for Tool-using Agents</strong> - Dawei Li, Yuguang Yao, Zhen Tan, Huan Liu, Ruocheng Guo - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.12294)</summary>

**Abstract:** Reward-guided search methods have demonstrated strong potential in enhancing tool-using agents by effectively guiding sampling and exploration over complex action spaces. As a core design, those search methods utilize process reward models (PRMs) to provide step-level rewards, enabling more fine-grained monitoring. However, there is a lack of systematic and reliable evaluation benchmarks for PRMs in tool-using settings. In this paper, we introduce ToolPRMBench, a large-scale benchmark specifically designed to evaluate PRMs for tool-using agents. ToolPRMBench is built on top of several representative tool-using benchmarks and converts agent trajectories into step-level test cases. Each case contains the interaction history, a correct action, a plausible but incorrect alternative, and relevant tool metadata. We respectively utilize offline sampling to isolate local single-step errors and online sampling to capture realistic multi-step failures from full agent rollouts. A multi-LLM verification pipeline is proposed to reduce label noise and ensure data quality. We conduct extensive experiments across large language models, general PRMs, and tool-specialized PRMs on ToolPRMBench. The results reveal clear differences in PRM effectiveness and highlight the potential of specialized PRMs for tool-using. Code and data will be released at this https URL.

<summary><strong>MedConsultBench: A Full-Cycle, Fine-Grained, Process-Aware Benchmark for Medical Consultation Agents</strong> - Chuhan Qiao, Jianghua Huang, Daxing Zhao, Ziding Liu, Yanjun Shen, Bing Cheng, Wei Lin, Kai Wu - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.12661)</summary>

**Abstract:** Current evaluations of medical consultation agents often prioritize outcome-oriented tasks, frequently overlooking the end-to-end process integrity and clinical safety essential for real-world practice. While recent interactive benchmarks have introduced dynamic scenarios, they often remain fragmented and coarse-grained, failing to capture the structured inquiry logic and diagnostic rigor required in professional consultations. To bridge this gap, we propose MedConsultBench, a comprehensive framework designed to evaluate the complete online consultation cycle by covering the entire clinical workflow from history taking and diagnosis to treatment planning and follow-up Q\&A. Our methodology introduces Atomic Information Units (AIUs) to track clinical information acquisition at a sub-turn level, enabling precise monitoring of how key facts are elicited through 22 fine-grained metrics. By addressing the underspecification and ambiguity inherent in online consultations, the benchmark evaluates uncertainty-aware yet concise inquiry while emphasizing medication regimen compatibility and the ability to handle realistic post-prescription follow-up Q\&A via constraint-respecting plan revisions. Systematic evaluation of 19 large language models reveals that high diagnostic accuracy often masks significant deficiencies in information-gathering efficiency and medication safety. These results underscore a critical gap between theoretical medical knowledge and clinical practice ability, establishing MedConsultBench as a rigorous foundation for aligning medical AI with the nuanced requirements of real-world clinical care.

<summary><strong>Vision Language Models for Optimization-Driven Intent Processing in Autonomous Networks</strong> - Tasnim Ahmed, Yifan Zhu, Salimur Choudhury - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.12744)</summary>

**Abstract:** Intent-Based Networking (IBN) allows operators to specify high-level network goals rather than low-level configurations. While recent work demonstrates that large language models can automate configuration tasks, a distinct class of intents requires generating optimization code to compute provably optimal solutions for traffic engineering, routing, and resource allocation. Current systems assume text-based intent expression, requiring operators to enumerate topologies and parameters in prose. Network practitioners naturally reason about structure through diagrams, yet whether Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can process annotated network sketches into correct optimization code remains unexplored. We present IntentOpt, a benchmark of 85 optimization problems across 17 categories, evaluating four VLMs (GPT-5-Mini, Claude-Haiku-4.5, Gemini-2.5-Flash, Llama-3.2-11B-Vision) under three prompting strategies on multimodal versus text-only inputs. Our evaluation shows that visual parameter extraction reduces execution success by 12-21 percentage points (pp), with GPT-5-Mini dropping from 93% to 72%. Program-of-thought prompting decreases performance by up to 13 pp, and open-source models lag behind closed-source ones, with Llama-3.2-11B-Vision reaching 18% compared to 75% for GPT-5-Mini. These results establish baseline capabilities and limitations of current VLMs for optimization code generation within an IBN system. We also demonstrate practical feasibility through a case study that deploys VLM-generated code to network testbed infrastructure using Model Context Protocol.

<summary><strong>MirrorGuard: Toward Secure Computer-Use Agents via Simulation-to-Real Reasoning Correction</strong> - Wenqi Zhang, Yulin Shen, Changyue Jiang, Jiarun Dai, Geng Hong, Xudong Pan - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.12822)</summary>

**Abstract:** Large foundation models are integrated into Computer Use Agents (CUAs), enabling autonomous interaction with operating systems through graphical user interfaces (GUIs) to perform complex tasks. This autonomy introduces serious security risks: malicious instructions or visual prompt injections can trigger unsafe reasoning and cause harmful system-level actions. Existing defenses, such as detection-based blocking, prevent damage but often abort tasks prematurely, reducing agent utility. In this paper, we present MirrorGuard, a plug-and-play defense framework that uses simulation-based training to improve CUA security in the real world. To reduce the cost of large-scale training in operating systems, we propose a novel neural-symbolic simulation pipeline, which generates realistic, high-risk GUI interaction trajectories entirely in a text-based simulated environment, which captures unsafe reasoning patterns and potential system hazards without executing real operations. In the simulation environment, MirrorGuard learns to intercept and rectify insecure reasoning chains of CUAs before they produce and execute unsafe actions. In real-world testing, extensive evaluations across diverse benchmarks and CUA architectures show that MirrorGuard significantly mitigates security risks. For instance, on the ByteDance UI-TARS system, it reduces the unsafe rate from 66.5% to 13.0% while maintaining a marginal false refusal rate (FRR). In contrast, the state-of-the-art GuardAgent only achieves a reduction to 53.9% and suffers from a 15.4% higher FRR. Our work proves that simulation-derived defenses can provide robust, real-world protection while maintaining the fundamental utility of the agent. Our code and model are publicly available at this https URL.

<summary><strong>AgenticRed: Optimizing Agentic Systems for Automated Red-teaming</strong> - Jiayi Yuan, Jonathan Nöther, Natasha Jaques, Goran Radanović - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.13518)</summary>

**Abstract:** While recent automated red-teaming methods show promise for systematically exposing model vulnerabilities, most existing approaches rely on human-specified workflows. This dependence on manually designed workflows suffers from human biases and makes exploring the broader design space expensive. We introduce AgenticRed, an automated pipeline that leverages LLMs' in-context learning to iteratively design and refine red-teaming systems without human intervention. Rather than optimizing attacker policies within predefined structures, AgenticRed treats red-teaming as a system design problem. Inspired by methods like Meta Agent Search, we develop a novel procedure for evolving agentic systems using evolutionary selection, and apply it to the problem of automatic red-teaming. Red-teaming systems designed by AgenticRed consistently outperform state-of-the-art approaches, achieving 96% attack success rate (ASR) on Llama-2-7B (36% improvement) and 98% on Llama-3-8B on HarmBench. Our approach exhibits strong transferability to proprietary models, achieving 100% ASR on GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4o-mini, and 60% on Claude-Sonnet-3.5 (24% improvement). This work highlights automated system design as a powerful paradigm for AI safety evaluation that can keep pace with rapidly evolving models.

<summary><strong>DSAEval: Evaluating Data Science Agents on a Wide Range of Real-World Data Science Problems</strong> - Maojun Sun, Yifei Xie, Yue Wu, Ruijian Han, Binyan Jiang, Defeng Sun, Yancheng Yuan, Jian Huang - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.13591)</summary>

**Abstract:** Recent LLM-based data agents aim to automate data science tasks ranging from data analysis to deep learning. However, the open-ended nature of real-world data science problems, which often span multiple taxonomies and lack standard answers, poses a significant challenge for evaluation. To address this, we introduce DSAEval, a benchmark comprising 641 real-world data science problems grounded in 285 diverse datasets, covering both structured and unstructured data (e.g., vision and text). DSAEval incorporates three distinctive features: (1) Multimodal Environment Perception, which enables agents to interpret observations from multiple modalities including text and vision; (2) Multi-Query Interactions, which mirror the iterative and cumulative nature of real-world data science projects; and (3) Multi-Dimensional Evaluation, which provides a holistic assessment across reasoning, code, and results. We systematically evaluate 11 advanced agentic LLMs using DSAEval. Our results show that Claude-Sonnet-4.5 achieves the strongest overall performance, GPT-5.2 is the most efficient, and MiMo-V2-Flash is the most cost-effective. We further demonstrate that multimodal perception consistently improves performance on vision-related tasks, with gains ranging from 2.04% to 11.30%. Overall, while current data science agents perform well on structured data and routine data anlysis workflows, substantial challenges remain in unstructured domains. Finally, we offer critical insights and outline future research directions to advance the development of data science agents.

<summary><strong>Autonomous Knowledge Graph Exploration with Adaptive Breadth-Depth Retrieval</strong> - Joaquín Polonuer, Lucas Vittor, Iñaki Arango, Ayush Noori, David A. Clifton, Luciano Del Corro, Marinka Zitnik - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.13969)</summary>

**Abstract:** Retrieving evidence for language model queries from knowledge graphs requires balancing broad search across the graph with multi-hop traversal to follow relational links. Similarity-based retrievers provide coverage but remain shallow, whereas traversal-based methods rely on selecting seed nodes to start exploration, which can fail when queries span multiple entities and relations. We introduce ARK: Adaptive Retriever of Knowledge, an agentic KG retriever that gives a language model control over this breadth-depth tradeoff using a two-operation toolset: global lexical search over node descriptors and one-hop neighborhood exploration that composes into multi-hop traversal. ARK alternates between breadth-oriented discovery and depth-oriented expansion without depending on a fragile seed selection, a pre-set hop depth, or requiring retrieval training. ARK adapts tool use to queries, using global search for language-heavy queries and neighborhood exploration for relation-heavy queries. On STaRK, ARK reaches 59.1% average Hit@1 and 67.4 average MRR, improving average Hit@1 by up to 31.4% and average MRR by up to 28.0% over retrieval-based and agentic training-free methods. Finally, we distill ARK's tool-use trajectories from a large teacher into an 8B model via label-free imitation, improving Hit@1 by +7.0, +26.6, and +13.5 absolute points over the base 8B model on AMAZON, MAG, and PRIME datasets, respectively, while retaining up to 98.5% of the teacher's Hit@1 rate.

<summary><strong>Numina-Lean-Agent: An Open and General Agentic Reasoning System for Formal Mathematics</strong> - Junqi Liu, Zihao Zhou, Zekai Zhu, Marco Dos Santos, Weikun He, Jiawei Liu, Ran Wang, Yunzhou Xie, Junqiao Zhao, Qiufeng Wang, Lihong Zhi, Jia Li, Wenda Li - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.14027)</summary>

**Abstract:** Agentic systems have recently become the dominant paradigm for formal theorem proving, achieving strong performance by coordinating multiple models and tools. However, existing approaches often rely on task-specific pipelines and trained formal provers, limiting their flexibility and reproducibility. In this paper, we propose the paradigm that directly uses a general coding agent as a formal math reasoner. This paradigm is motivated by (1) A general coding agent provides a natural interface for diverse reasoning tasks beyond proving, (2) Performance can be improved by simply replacing the underlying base model, without training, and (3) MCP enables flexible extension and autonomous calling of specialized tools, avoiding complex design. Based on this paradigm, we introduce Numina-Lean-Agent, which combines Claude Code with Numina-Lean-MCP to enable autonomous interaction with Lean, retrieval of relevant theorems, informal proving and auxiliary reasoning tools. Using Claude Opus 4.5 as the base model, Numina-Lean-Agent solves all problems in Putnam 2025 (12 / 12), matching the best closed-source system. Beyond benchmark evaluation, we further demonstrate its generality by interacting with mathematicians to successfully formalize the Brascamp-Lieb theorem. We release Numina-Lean-Agent and all solutions at this https URL.

**Abstract:** AI agents may soon become capable of autonomously completing valuable, long-horizon tasks in diverse domains. Current benchmarks either do not measure real-world tasks, or are not sufficiently difficult to meaningfully measure frontier models. To this end, we present Terminal-Bench 2.0: a carefully curated hard benchmark composed of 89 tasks in computer terminal environments inspired by problems from real workflows. Each task features a unique environment, human-written solution, and comprehensive tests for verification. We show that frontier models and agents score less than 65\% on the benchmark and conduct an error analysis to identify areas for model and agent improvement. We publish the dataset and evaluation harness to assist developers and researchers in future work at this https URL .

<summary><strong>AI Agents Need Memory Control Over More Context</strong> - Fouad Bousetouane - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.11653)</summary>

**Abstract:** AI agents are increasingly used in long, multi-turn workflows in both research and enterprise settings. As interactions grow, agent behavior often degrades due to loss of constraint focus, error accumulation, and memory-induced drift. This problem is especially visible in real-world deployments where context evolves, distractions are introduced, and decisions must remain consistent over time. A common practice is to equip agents with persistent memory through transcript replay or retrieval-based mechanisms. While convenient, these approaches introduce unbounded context growth and are vulnerable to noisy recall and memory poisoning, leading to unstable behavior and increased drift. In this work, we introduce the Agent Cognitive Compressor (ACC), a bio-inspired memory controller that replaces transcript replay with a bounded internal state updated online at each turn. ACC separates artifact recall from state commitment, enabling stable conditioning while preventing unverified content from becoming persistent memory. We evaluate ACC using an agent-judge-driven live evaluation framework that measures both task outcomes and memory-driven anomalies across extended interactions. Across scenarios spanning IT operations, cybersecurity response, and healthcare workflows, ACC consistently maintains bounded memory and exhibits more stable multi-turn behavior, with significantly lower hallucination and drift than transcript replay and retrieval-based agents. These results show that cognitive compression provides a practical and effective foundation for reliable memory control in long-horizon AI agents.

<summary><strong>CooperBench: Why Coding Agents Cannot be Your Teammates Yet</strong> - Arpandeep Khatua, Hao Zhu, Peter Tran, Arya Prabhudesai, Frederic Sadrieh, Johann K. Lieberwirth, Xinkai Yu, Yicheng Fu, Michael J. Ryan, Jiaxin Pei, Diyi Yang - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.13295)</summary>

**Abstract:** Resolving team conflicts requires not only task-specific competence, but also social intelligence to find common ground and build consensus. As AI agents increasingly collaborate on complex work, they must develop coordination capabilities to function as effective teammates. Yet we hypothesize that current agents lack these capabilities. To test this, we introduce CooperBench, a benchmark of over 600 collaborative coding tasks across 12 libraries in 4 programming languages. Each task assigns two agents different features that can be implemented independently but may conflict without proper coordination. Tasks are grounded in real open-source repositories with expert-written tests. Evaluating state-of-the-art coding agents, we observe the curse of coordination: agents achieve on average 30% lower success rates when working together compared to performing both tasks individually. This contrasts sharply with human teams, where adding teammates typically improves productivity. Our analysis reveals three key issues: (1) communication channels become jammed with vague, ill-timed, and inaccurate messages; (2) even with effective communication, agents deviate from their commitments; and (3) agents often hold incorrect expectations about others' plans and communication. Through large-scale simulation, we also observe rare but interesting emergent coordination behavior including role division, resource division, and negotiation. Our research presents a novel benchmark for collaborative coding and calls for a shift from pursuing individual agent capability to developing social intelligence.

**Abstract:** Making deep learning recommendation model (DLRM) training and inference fast and efficient is important. However, this presents three key system challenges - model architecture diversity, kernel primitive diversity, and hardware generation and architecture heterogeneity. This paper presents KernelEvolve-an agentic kernel coding framework-to tackle heterogeneity at-scale for DLRM. KernelEvolve is designed to take kernel specifications as input and automate the process of kernel generation and optimization for recommendation model across heterogeneous hardware architectures. KernelEvolve does so by operating at multiple programming abstractions, from Triton and CuTe DSL to low-level hardware agnostic languages, spanning the full hardware-software optimization stack. The kernel optimization process is described as graph-based search with selection policy, universal operator, fitness function, and termination rule, dynamically adapts to runtime execution context through retrieval-augmented prompt synthesis. We designed, implemented, and deployed KernelEvolve to optimize a wide variety of production recommendation models across generations of NVIDIA and AMD GPUs, as well as Meta's AI accelerators. We validate KernelEvolve on the publicly-available KernelBench suite, achieving 100% pass rate on all 250 problems across three difficulty levels, and 160 PyTorch ATen operators across three heterogeneous hardware platforms, demonstrating 100% correctness. KernelEvolve reduces development time from weeks to hours and achieves substantial performance improvements over PyTorch baselines across diverse production use cases and for heterogeneous AI systems at-scale. Beyond performance efficiency improvements, KernelEvolve significantly mitigates the programmability barrier for new AI hardware by enabling automated kernel generation for in-house developed AI hardware.

<summary><strong>Beyond Single-shot Writing: Deep Research Agents are Unreliable at Multi-turn Report Revision</strong> - Bingsen Chen, Boyan Li, Ping Nie, Yuyu Zhang, Xi Ye, Chen Zhao - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.13217)</summary>

**Abstract:** Existing benchmarks for Deep Research Agents (DRAs) treat report generation as a single-shot writing task, which fundamentally diverges from how human researchers iteratively draft and revise reports via self-reflection or peer feedback. Whether DRAs can reliably revise reports with user feedback remains unexplored. We introduce Mr Dre, an evaluation suite that establishes multi-turn report revision as a new evaluation axis for DRAs. Mr Dre consists of (1) a unified long-form report evaluation protocol spanning comprehensiveness, factuality, and presentation, and (2) a human-verified feedback simulation pipeline for multi-turn revision. Our analysis of five diverse DRAs reveals a critical limitation: while agents can address most user feedback, they also regress on 16-27% of previously covered content and citation quality. Over multiple revision turns, even the best-performing agents leave significant headroom, as they continue to disrupt content outside the feedback's scope and fail to preserve earlier edits. We further show that these issues are not easily resolvable through inference-time fixes such as prompt engineering and a dedicated sub-agent for report revision.

<summary><strong>AgentEHR: Advancing Autonomous Clinical Decision-Making via Retrospective Summarization</strong> - Yusheng Liao, Chuan Xuan, Yutong Cai, Lina Yang, Zhe Chen, Yanfeng Wang, Yu Wang - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.13918)</summary>

**Abstract:** Large Language Models have demonstrated profound utility in the medical domain. However, their application to autonomous Electronic Health Records~(EHRs) navigation remains constrained by a reliance on curated inputs and simplified retrieval tasks. To bridge the gap between idealized experimental settings and realistic clinical environments, we present AgentEHR. This benchmark challenges agents to execute complex decision-making tasks, such as diagnosis and treatment planning, requiring long-range interactive reasoning directly within raw and high-noise databases. In tackling these tasks, we identify that existing summarization methods inevitably suffer from critical information loss and fractured reasoning continuity. To address this, we propose RetroSum, a novel framework that unifies a retrospective summarization mechanism with an evolving experience strategy. By dynamically re-evaluating interaction history, the retrospective mechanism prevents long-context information loss and ensures unbroken logical coherence. Additionally, the evolving strategy bridges the domain gap by retrieving accumulated experience from a memory bank. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that RetroSum achieves performance gains of up to 29.16% over competitive baselines, while significantly decreasing total interaction errors by up to 92.3%.

**Abstract:** Recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated strong potential for device control. However, existing research has primarily focused on point-and-click (PnC) interaction, while remote-control (RC) interaction commonly encountered in everyday TV usage remains largely underexplored. To fill this gap, we introduce \textbf{TVWorld}, an offline graph-based abstraction of real-world TV navigation that enables reproducible and deployment-free evaluation. On this basis, we derive two complementary benchmarks that comprehensively assess TV-use capabilities: \textbf{TVWorld-N} for topology-aware navigation and \textbf{TVWorld-G} for focus-aware grounding. These benchmarks expose a key limitation of existing agents: insufficient topology awareness for focus-based, long-horizon TV navigation. Motivated by this finding, we propose a \emph{Topology-Aware Training} framework that injects topology awareness into LVLMs. Using this framework, we develop \textbf{TVTheseus}, a foundation model specialized for TV navigation. TVTheseus achieves a success rate of $68.3\%$ on TVWorld-N, surpassing strong closed-source baselines such as Gemini 3 Flash and establishing state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. Additional analyses further provide valuable insights into the development of effective TV-use agents.

**Abstract:** Tool learning is increasingly important for large language models (LLMs) to effectively coordinate and utilize a diverse set of tools in order to solve complex real-world tasks. By selecting and integrating appropriate tools, LLMs extend their capabilities beyond pure language understanding to perform specialized functions. However, existing methods for tool selection often focus on limited tool sets and struggle to generalize to novel tools encountered in practical deployments. To address these challenges, we introduce a comprehensive dataset spanning 7 domains, containing 155 tools and 9,377 question-answer pairs, which simulates realistic integration scenarios. Additionally, we propose MetaToolAgent (MTA), a meta-learning approach designed to improve cross-tool generalization. Experimental results show that MTA significantly outperforms baseline methods on unseen tools, demonstrating its promise for building flexible and scalable systems that require dynamic tool coordination.

<summary><strong>CooperLLM: Cloud-Edge-End Cooperative Federated Fine-tuning for LLMs via ZOO-based Gradient Correction</strong> - He Sun, Jinrui Zhou, Li Li, Mingjun Xiao - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.12917)</summary>

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well on many NLP tasks, but fine-tuning them on resource-constrained mobile devices is challenging due to high memory and computation costs, despite growing demands for privacy-preserving personalization. Federated Learning (FL) enables local-data training, yet existing methods either rely on memory-intensive backpropagation or use zeroth-order optimization (ZOO), which avoids backward passes but suffers from slow convergence and degraded accuracy. We propose CooperLLM, a cloud-assisted edge-end cooperative federated fine-tuning framework that combines ZOO on mobile devices with cloud-guided gradient rectification. Mobile clients perform lightweight ZOO updates on private data, while the cloud fine-tunes on auxiliary public data using backpropagation and injects guided perturbations to rectify local updates, improving convergence and accuracy without violating privacy. To address system bottlenecks, CooperLLM introduces pipeline scheduling and adaptive compression to overlap computation and communication and reduce memory usage. Experiments on multiple Transformer models and datasets show that CooperLLM reduces on-device memory by up to $86.4\%$, accelerates convergence by $8.8 \times$, and improves accuracy by up to 10 percentage points over state-of-the-art ZOO-based baselines.

<summary><strong>Neural Process-Based Reactive Controller for Autonomous Racing</strong> - Devin Hunter, Chinwendu Enyioha - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.12143)</summary>

**Abstract:** Attention-based neural architectures have become central to state-of-the-art methods in real-time nonlinear control. As these data-driven models continue to be integrated into increasingly safety-critical domains, ensuring statistically grounded and provably safe decision-making becomes essential. This paper introduces a novel reactive control framework for gap-based navigation using the Attentive Neural Process (AttNP) and a physics-informed extension, the PI-AttNP. Both models are evaluated in a simulated F1TENTH-style Ackermann steering racecar environment, chosen as a fast-paced proxy for safety-critical autonomous driving scenarios. The PI-AttNP augments the AttNP architecture with approximate model-based priors to inject physical inductive bias, enabling faster convergence and improved prediction accuracy suited for real-time control. To further ensure safety, we derive and implement a control barrier function (CBF)-based filtering mechanism that analytically enforces collision avoidance constraints. This CBF formulation is fully compatible with the learned AttNP controller and generalizes across a wide range of racing scenarios, providing a lightweight and certifiable safety layer. Our results demonstrate competitive closed-loop performance while ensuring real-time constraint satisfaction.

<summary><strong>LogicEnvGen: Task-Logic Driven Generation of Diverse Simulated Environments for Embodied AI</strong> - Jianan Wang, Siyang Zhang, Bin Li, Juan Chen, Jingtao Qi, Zhuo Zhang, Chen Qian - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.13556)</summary>

**Abstract:** Simulated environments play an essential role in embodied AI, functionally analogous to test cases in software engineering. However, existing environment generation methods often emphasize visual realism (e.g., object diversity and layout coherence), overlooking a crucial aspect: logical diversity from the testing perspective. This limits the comprehensive evaluation of agent adaptability and planning robustness in distinct simulated environments. To bridge this gap, we propose LogicEnvGen, a novel method driven by Large Language Models (LLMs) that adopts a top-down paradigm to generate logically diverse simulated environments as test cases for agents. Given an agent task, LogicEnvGen first analyzes its execution logic to construct decision-tree-structured behavior plans and then synthesizes a set of logical trajectories. Subsequently, it adopts a heuristic algorithm to refine the trajectory set, reducing redundant simulation. For each logical trajectory, which represents a potential task situation, LogicEnvGen correspondingly instantiates a concrete environment. Notably, it employs constraint solving for physical plausibility. Furthermore, we introduce LogicEnvEval, a novel benchmark comprising four quantitative metrics for environment evaluation. Experimental results verify the lack of logical diversity in baselines and demonstrate that LogicEnvGen achieves 1.04-2.61x greater diversity, significantly improving the performance in revealing agent faults by 4.00%-68.00%.

**Abstract:** Drones operating in human-occupied spaces suffer from insufficient communication mechanisms that create uncertainty about their intentions. We present HoverAI, an embodied aerial agent that integrates drone mobility, infrastructure-independent visual projection, and real-time conversational AI into a unified platform. Equipped with a MEMS laser projector, onboard semi-rigid screen, and RGB camera, HoverAI perceives users through vision and voice, responding via lip-synced avatars that adapt appearance to user demographics. The system employs a multimodal pipeline combining VAD, ASR (Whisper), LLM-based intent classification, RAG for dialogue, face analysis for personalization, and voice synthesis (XTTS v2). Evaluation demonstrates high accuracy in command recognition (F1: 0.90), demographic estimation (gender F1: 0.89, age MAE: 5.14 years), and speech transcription (WER: 0.181). By uniting aerial robotics with adaptive conversational AI and self-contained visual output, HoverAI introduces a new class of spatially-aware, socially responsive embodied agents for applications in guidance, assistance, and human-centered interaction.

<summary><strong>TwinBrainVLA: Unleashing the Potential of Generalist VLMs for Embodied Tasks via Asymmetric Mixture-of-Transformers</strong> - Bin Yu, Shijie Lian, Xiaopeng Lin, Yuliang Wei, Zhaolong Shen, Changti Wu, Yuzhuo Miao, Xinming Wang, Bailing Wang, Cong Huang, Kai Chen - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.14133)</summary>

**Abstract:** Standard Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models typically fine-tune a monolithic Vision-Language Model (VLM) backbone explicitly for robotic control. However, this approach creates a critical tension between maintaining high-level general semantic understanding and learning low-level, fine-grained sensorimotor skills, often leading to "catastrophic forgetting" of the model's open-world capabilities. To resolve this conflict, we introduce TwinBrainVLA, a novel architecture that coordinates a generalist VLM retaining universal semantic understanding and a specialist VLM dedicated to embodied proprioception for joint robotic control. TwinBrainVLA synergizes a frozen "Left Brain", which retains robust general visual reasoning, with a trainable "Right Brain", specialized for embodied perception, via a novel Asymmetric Mixture-of-Transformers (AsyMoT) mechanism. This design allows the Right Brain to dynamically query semantic knowledge from the frozen Left Brain and fuse it with proprioceptive states, providing rich conditioning for a Flow-Matching Action Expert to generate precise continuous controls. Extensive experiments on SimplerEnv and RoboCasa benchmarks demonstrate that TwinBrainVLA achieves superior manipulation performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines while explicitly preserving the comprehensive visual understanding capabilities of the pre-trained VLM, offering a promising direction for building general-purpose robots that simultaneously achieve high-level semantic understanding and low-level physical dexterity.

<summary><strong>Listen, Look, Drive: Coupling Audio Instructions for User-aware VLA-based Autonomous Driving</strong> - Ziang Guo, Feng Yang, Xuefeng Zhang, Jiaqi Guo, Kun Zhao, Peng Lu, Zufeng Zhang, Sifa Zheng - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.12142)</summary>

**Abstract:** Vision Language Action (VLA) models promise an open-vocabulary interface that can translate perceptual ambiguity into semantically grounded driving decisions, yet they still treat language as a static prior fixed at inference time. As a result, the model must infer continuously shifting objectives from pixels alone, yielding delayed or overly conservative maneuvers. We argue that effective VLAs for autonomous driving need an online channel in which users can influence driving with specific intentions. To this end, we present EchoVLA, a user-aware VLA that couples camera streams with in situ audio instructions. We augment the nuScenes dataset with temporally aligned, intent-specific speech commands generated by converting ego-motion descriptions into synthetic audios. Further, we compose emotional speech-trajectory pairs into a multimodal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) for fine-tuning a Multimodal Large Model (MLM) based on Qwen2.5-Omni. Specifically, we synthesize the audio-augmented dataset with different emotion types paired with corresponding driving behaviors, leveraging the emotional cues embedded in tone, pitch, and speech tempo to reflect varying user states, such as urgent or hesitant intentions, thus enabling our EchoVLA to interpret not only the semantic content but also the emotional context of audio commands for more nuanced and emotionally adaptive driving behavior. In open-loop benchmarks, our approach reduces the average L2 error by $59.4\%$ and the collision rate by $74.4\%$ compared to the baseline of vision-only perception. More experiments on nuScenes dataset validate that EchoVLA not only steers the trajectory through audio instructions, but also modulates driving behavior in response to the emotions detected in the user's speech.

**Abstract:** The escalating accumulation of orbital debris threatens the sustainability of space operations, necessitating active removal solutions that overcome the limitations of current fuel-dependent methods. To address this, this study introduces a novel remediation architecture that integrates a mechanical clamping system for secure capture with a high-efficiency, solar-powered NASA Evolutionary Xenon Thruster (NEXT) and autonomous navigation protocols. High-fidelity simulations validate the architecture's capabilities, demonstrating a successful retrograde deorbit from 800 km to 100 km, <10m position Root Mean Square Errors (RMSE) via radar-based Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) navigation, and a 93\% data delivery efficiency within 1 second using Delay/Disruption Tolerant Network (DTN) protocols. This approach significantly advances orbital management by establishing a benchmark for renewable solar propulsion that minimizes reliance on conventional fuels and extends mission longevity for multi-target removal.

**Abstract:** Vision-language-action models have gained significant attention for their ability to model multimodal sequences in embodied instruction following tasks.

In this paper, we introduce Astra, a novel Transformer architecture featuring trajectory attention and learnable action queries, designed to efficiently process segmented multimodal trajectories and predict actions for imitation learning. Furthermore, we propose a contrastive dynamics learning objective to enhance the model's understanding of environment dynamics and multimodal alignment, complementing the primary behavior cloning objective. Through extensive experiments on three large-scale robot manipulation benchmarks, Astra demonstrates substantial performance improvements over previous models.

**Abstract:** The emergence of LLMs has catalyzed a paradigm shift in autonomous agent development, enabling systems capable of reasoning, planning, and executing complex multi-step tasks. However, existing agent frameworks often suffer from architectural rigidity, vendor lock-in, and prohibitive complexity that impedes rapid prototyping and deployment. This paper presents AgentForge, a lightweight, open-source Python framework designed to democratize the construction of LLM-driven autonomous agents through a principled modular architecture. AgentForge introduces three key innovations: (1) a composable skill abstraction that enables fine-grained task decomposition with formally defined input-output contracts, (2) a unified LLM backend interface supporting seamless switching between cloud-based APIs and local inference engines, and (3) a declarative YAML-based configuration system that separates agent logic from implementation details. We formalize the skill composition mechanism as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) and prove its expressiveness for representing arbitrary sequential and parallel task workflows. Comprehensive experimental evaluation across four benchmark scenarios demonstrates that AgentForge achieves competitive task completion rates while reducing development time by 62% compared to LangChain and 78% compared to direct API integration. Latency measurements confirm sub-100ms orchestration overhead, rendering the framework suitable for real-time applications. The modular design facilitates extension: we demonstrate the integration of six built-in skills and provide comprehensive documentation for custom skill development. AgentForge addresses a critical gap in the LLM agent ecosystem by providing researchers and practitioners with a production-ready foundation for constructing, evaluating, and deploying autonomous agents without sacrificing flexibility or performance.

<summary><strong>Large Language Model Agent for User-friendly Chemical Process Simulations</strong> - Jingkang Liang, Niklas Groll, Gürkan Sin - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.11650)</summary>

**Abstract:** Modern process simulators enable detailed process design, simulation, and optimization; however, constructing and interpreting simulations is time-consuming and requires expert knowledge. This limits early exploration by inexperienced users. To address this, a large language model (LLM) agent is integrated with AVEVA Process Simulation (APS) via Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing natural language interaction with rigorous process simulations. An MCP server toolset enables the LLM to communicate programmatically with APS using Python, allowing it to execute complex simulation tasks from plain-language instructions. Two water-methanol separation case studies assess the framework across different task complexities and interaction modes. The first shows the agent autonomously analyzing flowsheets, finding improvement opportunities, and iteratively optimizing, extracting data, and presenting results clearly. The framework benefits both educational purposes, by translating technical concepts and demonstrating workflows, and experienced practitioners by automating data extraction, speeding routine tasks, and supporting brainstorming. The second case study assesses autonomous flowsheet synthesis through both a step-by-step dialogue and a single prompt, demonstrating its potential for novices and experts alike. The step-by-step mode gives reliable, guided construction suitable for educational contexts; the single-prompt mode constructs fast baseline flowsheets for later refinement. While current limitations such as oversimplification, calculation errors, and technical hiccups mean expert oversight is still needed, the framework's capabilities in analysis, optimization, and guided construction suggest LLM-based agents can become valuable collaborators.

<summary><strong>SpecMap: Hierarchical LLM Agent for Datasheet-to-Code Traceability Link Recovery in Systems Engineering</strong> - Vedant Nipane, Pulkit Agrawal, Amit Singh - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.11688)</summary>

**Abstract:** Establishing precise traceability between embedded systems datasheets and their corresponding code implementations remains a fundamental challenge in systems engineering, particularly for low-level software where manual mapping between specification documents and large code repositories is infeasible. Existing Traceability Link Recovery approaches primarily rely on lexical similarity and information retrieval techniques, which struggle to capture the semantic, structural, and symbol level relationships prevalent in embedded systems software. We present a hierarchical datasheet-to-code mapping methodology that employs large language models for semantic analysis while explicitly structuring the traceability process across multiple abstraction levels. Rather than performing direct specification-to-code matching, the proposed approach progressively narrows the search space through repository-level structure inference, file-level relevance estimation, and fine-grained symbollevel alignment. The method extends beyond function-centric mapping by explicitly covering macros, structs, constants, configuration parameters, and register definitions commonly found in systems-level C/C++ codebases. We evaluate the approach on multiple open-source embedded systems repositories using manually curated datasheet-to-code ground truth. Experimental results show substantial improvements over traditional information-retrieval-based baselines, achieving up to 73.3% file mapping accuracy. We significantly reduce computational overhead, lowering total LLM token consumption by 84% and end-to-end runtime by approximately 80%. This methodology supports automated analysis of large embedded software systems and enables downstream applications such as training data generation for systems-aware machine learning models, standards compliance verification, and large-scale specification coverage analysis.

<summary><strong>Entropic Context Shaping: Information-Theoretic Filtering for Context-Aware LLM Agents</strong> - Hyunjun Kim - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.11585)</summary>

**Abstract:** Context engineering for large language model (LLM) agents requires distinguishing pragmatically useful information from misleading distractors. We introduce Entropic Context Shaping (ECS), an information-theoretic framework that measures context utility via the shift in the model's answer distribution toward the correct answer. Unlike lexical similarity methods that rely on word overlap, ECS captures pragmatic utility -- whether a passage actually helps answer the question. We formalize utility as the signed change in answer probability and provide theoretical analysis showing that task-irrelevant updates yield near-zero distribution shift. We evaluate on multi-turn context selection tasks using LongMemEval (session-level) and LoCoMo (turn-level) benchmarks. On fine-grained turn selection, ECS with Llama-3.1-8B achieves F1=0.265, a 71.83% relative improvement over TF-IDF (F1=0.154), demonstrating that pragmatic utility outperforms lexical similarity when precise context selection matters. Code and data are available in the supplementary materials.

**Abstract:** Overlapping calendar invitations force busy professionals to repeatedly decide which meetings to attend, reschedule, or decline. We refer to this preference-driven decision process as calendar conflict resolution. Automating such process is crucial yet challenging. Scheduling logistics drain hours, and human delegation often fails at scale, which motivate we to ask: Can we trust large language model (LLM) or language agent to manager time? To enable systematic study of this question, we introduce CalConflictBench, a benchmark for long-horizon calendar conflict resolution. Conflicts are presented sequentially and agents receive feedback after each round, requiring them to infer and adapt to user preferences progressively. Our experiments show that current LLM agents perform poorly with high error rates, e.g., Qwen-3-30B-Think has 35% average error rate. To address this gap, we propose PEARL, a reinforcement-learning framework that augments language agent with an external memory module and optimized round-wise reward design, enabling agent to progressively infer and adapt to user preferences on-the-fly. Experiments on CalConflictBench shows that PEARL achieves 0.76 error reduction rate, and 55% improvement in average error rate compared to the strongest baseline.

**Abstract:** Enterprise back office workflows require agentic systems that are auditable, policy-aligned, and operationally predictable, capabilities that generic multi-agent setups often fail to deliver. We present POLARIS (Policy-Aware LLM Agentic Reasoning for Integrated Systems), a governed orchestration framework that treats automation as typed plan synthesis and validated execution over LLM agents. A planner proposes structurally diverse, type checked directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), a rubric guided reasoning module selects a single compliant plan, and execution is guarded by validator gated checks, a bounded repair loop, and compiled policy guardrails that block or route side effects before they occur. Applied to document centric finance tasks, POLARIS produces decision grade artifacts and full execution traces while reducing human intervention.

<summary><strong>Multi-agent DRL-based Lane Change Decision Model for Cooperative Planning in Mixed Traffic</strong> - Zeyu Mu, Shangtong Zhang, B. Brian Park - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.11809)</summary>

**Abstract:** Connected automated vehicles (CAVs) possess the ability to communicate and coordinate with one another, enabling cooperative platooning that enhances both energy efficiency and traffic flow. However, during the initial stage of CAV deployment, the sparse distribution of CAVs among human-driven vehicles reduces the likelihood of forming effective cooperative platoons. To address this challenge, this study proposes a hybrid multi-agent lane change decision model aimed at increasing CAV participation in cooperative platooning and maximizing its associated benefits. The proposed model employs the QMIX framework, integrating traffic data processed through a convolutional neural network (CNN-QMIX). This architecture addresses a critical issue in dynamic traffic scenarios by enabling CAVs to make optimal decisions irrespective of the varying number of CAVs present in mixed traffic. Additionally, a trajectory planner and a model predictive controller are designed to ensure smooth and safe lane-change execution. The proposed model is trained and evaluated within a microsimulation environment under varying CAV market penetration rates. The results demonstrate that the proposed model efficiently manages fluctuating traffic agent numbers, significantly outperforming the baseline rule-based models. Notably, it enhances cooperative platooning rates up to 26.2\%, showcasing its potential to optimize CAV cooperation and traffic dynamics during the early stage of deployment.

<summary><strong>AEMA: Verifiable Evaluation Framework for Trustworthy and Controlled Agentic LLM Systems</strong> - YenTing Lee, Keerthi Koneru, Zahra Moslemi, Sheethal Kumar, Ramesh Radhakrishnan - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.11903)</summary>

**Abstract:** Evaluating large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems remains a critical challenge, as these systems must exhibit reliable coordination, transparent decision-making, and verifiable performance across evolving tasks. Existing evaluation approaches often limit themselves to single-response scoring or narrow benchmarks, which lack stability, extensibility, and automation when deployed in enterprise settings at multi-agent scale. We present AEMA (Adaptive Evaluation Multi-Agent), a process-aware and auditable framework that plans, executes, and aggregates multi-step evaluations across heterogeneous agentic workflows under human oversight. Compared to a single LLM-as-a-Judge, AEMA achieves greater stability, human alignment, and traceable records that support accountable automation. Our results on enterprise-style agent workflows simulated using realistic business scenarios demonstrate that AEMA provides a transparent and reproducible pathway toward responsible evaluation of LLM-based multi-agent systems.

<summary><strong>A Multi-Agent System for Generating Actionable Business Advice</strong> - Kartikey Singh Bhandari, Tanish Jain, Archit Agrawal, Dhruv Kumar, Praveen Kumar, Pratik Narang - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.12024)</summary>

**Abstract:** Customer reviews contain rich signals about product weaknesses and unmet user needs, yet existing analytic methods rarely move beyond descriptive tasks such as sentiment analysis or aspect extraction. While large language models (LLMs) can generate free-form suggestions, their outputs often lack accuracy and depth of reasoning. In this paper, we present a multi-agent, LLM-based framework for prescriptive decision support, which transforms large scale review corpora into actionable business advice. The framework integrates four components: clustering to select representative reviews, generation of advices, iterative evaluation, and feasibility based ranking. This design couples corpus distillation with feedback driven advice refinement to produce outputs that are specific, actionable, and practical. Experiments across three service domains and multiple model families show that our framework consistently outperform single model baselines on actionability, specificity, and non-redundancy, with medium sized models approaching the performance of large model frameworks.

**Abstract:** Reasoning is a fundamental cognitive process underlying inference, problem-solving, and decision-making. While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities in closed-world settings, they struggle in open-ended and dynamic environments. Agentic reasoning marks a paradigm shift by reframing LLMs as autonomous agents that plan, act, and learn through continual interaction. In this survey, we organize agentic reasoning along three complementary dimensions. First, we characterize environmental dynamics through three layers: foundational agentic reasoning, which establishes core single-agent capabilities including planning, tool use, and search in stable environments; self-evolving agentic reasoning, which studies how agents refine these capabilities through feedback, memory, and adaptation; and collective multi-agent reasoning, which extends intelligence to collaborative settings involving coordination, knowledge sharing, and shared goals. Across these layers, we distinguish in-context reasoning, which scales test-time interaction through structured orchestration, from post-training reasoning, which optimizes behaviors via reinforcement learning and supervised fine-tuning. We further review representative agentic reasoning frameworks across real-world applications and benchmarks, including science, robotics, healthcare, autonomous research, and mathematics. This survey synthesizes agentic reasoning methods into a unified roadmap bridging thought and action, and outlines open challenges and future directions, including personalization, long-horizon interaction, world modeling, scalable multi-agent training, and governance for real-world deployment.

**Abstract:** Artificial intelligence systems for scientific discovery have demonstrated remarkable potential, yet existing approaches remain largely proprietary and operate in batch-processing modes requiring hours per research cycle, precluding real-time researcher guidance. This paper introduces Deep Research, a multi-agent system enabling interactive scientific investigation with turnaround times measured in minutes. The architecture comprises specialized agents for planning, data analysis, literature search, and novelty detection, unified through a persistent world state that maintains context across iterative research cycles. Two operational modes support different workflows: semi-autonomous mode with selective human checkpoints, and fully autonomous mode for extended investigations. Evaluation on the BixBench computational biology benchmark demonstrated state-of-the-art performance, achieving 48.8% accuracy on open response and 64.5% on multiple-choice evaluation, exceeding existing baselines by 14 to 26 percentage points. Analysis of architectural constraints, including open access literature limitations and challenges inherent to automated novelty assessment, informs practical deployment considerations for AI-assisted scientific workflows.

<summary><strong>Agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI): Architectures, Taxonomies, and Evaluation of Large Language Model Agents</strong> - Arunkumar V, Gangadharan G.R., Rajkumar Buyya - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.12560)</summary>

**Abstract:** Artificial Intelligence is moving from models that only generate text to Agentic AI, where systems behave as autonomous entities that can perceive, reason, plan, and act. Large Language Models (LLMs) are no longer used only as passive knowledge engines but as cognitive controllers that combine memory, tool use, and feedback from their environment to pursue extended goals. This shift already supports the automation of complex workflows in software engineering, scientific discovery, and web navigation, yet the variety of emerging designs, from simple single loop agents to hierarchical multi agent systems, makes the landscape hard to navigate. In this paper, we investigate architectures and propose a unified taxonomy that breaks agents into Perception, Brain, Planning, Action, Tool Use, and Collaboration. We use this lens to describe the move from linear reasoning procedures to native inference time reasoning models, and the transition from fixed API calls to open standards like the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Native Computer Use. We also group the environments in which these agents operate, including digital operating systems, embodied robotics, and other specialized domains, and we review current evaluation practices. Finally, we highlight open challenges, such as hallucination in action, infinite loops, and prompt injection, and outline future research directions toward more robust and reliable autonomous systems.

**Abstract:** Graphical user interface (GUI) agents are rapidly progressing toward autonomous interaction and reliable task execution across diverse applications. However, two central challenges remain unresolved: automating the evaluation of agent trajectories and generating high-quality training data at scale to enable continual improvement. Existing approaches often depend on manual annotation or static rule-based verification, which restricts scalability and limits adaptability in dynamic environments. We present MagicGUI-RMS, a multi-agent reward model system that delivers adaptive trajectory evaluation, corrective feedback, and self-evolving learning capabilities. MagicGUI-RMS integrates a Domain-Specific Reward Model (DS-RM) with a General-Purpose Reward Model (GP-RM), enabling fine-grained action assessment and robust generalization across heterogeneous GUI tasks. To support reward learning at scale, we design a structured data construction pipeline that automatically produces balanced and diverse reward datasets, effectively reducing annotation costs while maintaining sample fidelity. During execution, the reward model system identifies erroneous actions, proposes refined alternatives, and continuously enhances agent behavior through an automated data-reflux mechanism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MagicGUI-RMS yields substantial gains in task accuracy, behavioral robustness. These results establish MagicGUI-RMS as a principled and effective foundation for building self-improving GUI agents driven by reward-based adaptation.

<summary><strong>Prompt Injection Mitigation with Agentic AI, Nested Learning, and AI Sustainability via Semantic Caching</strong> - Diego Gosmar, Deborah A. Dahl - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.13186)</summary>

**Abstract:** Prompt injection remains a central obstacle to the safe deployment of large language models, particularly in multi-agent settings where intermediate outputs can propagate or amplify malicious instructions. Building on earlier work that introduced a four-metric Total Injection Vulnerability Score (TIVS), this paper extends the evaluation framework with semantic similarity-based caching and a fifth metric (Observability Score Ratio) to yield TIVS-O, investigating how defence effectiveness interacts with transparency in a HOPE-inspired Nested Learning architecture. The proposed system combines an agentic pipeline with Continuum Memory Systems that implement semantic similarity-based caching across 301 synthetically generated injection-focused prompts drawn from ten attack families, while a fourth agent performs comprehensive security analysis using five key performance indicators. In addition to traditional injection metrics, OSR quantifies the richness and clarity of security-relevant reasoning exposed by each agent, enabling an explicit analysis of trade-offs between strict mitigation and auditability. Experiments show that the system achieves secure responses with zero high-risk breaches, while semantic caching delivers substantial computational savings, achieving a 41.6% reduction in LLM calls and corresponding decreases in latency, energy consumption, and carbon emissions. Five TIVS-O configurations reveal optimal trade-offs between mitigation strictness and forensic transparency. These results indicate that observability-aware evaluation can reveal non-monotonic effects within multi-agent pipelines and that memory-augmented agents can jointly maximize security robustness, real-time performance, operational cost savings, and environmental sustainability without modifying underlying model weights, providing a production-ready pathway for secure and green LLM deployments.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in healthcare, yet ensuring their ethical integrity and safety compliance remains a major barrier to clinical deployment. This work introduces a multi-agent refinement framework designed to enhance the safety and reliability of medical LLMs through structured, iterative alignment. Our system combines two generative models - DeepSeek R1 and Med-PaLM - with two evaluation agents, LLaMA 3.1 and Phi-4, which assess responses using the American Medical Association's (AMA) Principles of Medical Ethics and a five-tier Safety Risk Assessment (SRA-5) protocol. We evaluate performance across 900 clinically diverse queries spanning nine ethical domains, measuring convergence efficiency, ethical violation reduction, and domain-specific risk behavior. Results demonstrate that DeepSeek R1 achieves faster convergence (mean 2.34 vs. 2.67 iterations), while Med-PaLM shows superior handling of privacy-sensitive scenarios. The iterative multi-agent loop achieved an 89% reduction in ethical violations and a 92% risk downgrade rate, underscoring the effectiveness of our approach. This study presents a scalable, regulator-aligned, and cost-efficient paradigm for governing medical AI safety.

<summary><strong>Towards Efficient and Robust Linguistic Emotion Diagnosis for Mental Health via Multi-Agent Instruction Refinement</strong> - Jian Zhang, Zhangqi Wang, Zhiyuan Wang, Weiping Fu, Yu He, Haiping Zhu, Qika Lin, Jun Liu - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.13481)</summary>

**Abstract:** Linguistic expressions of emotions such as depression, anxiety, and trauma-related states are pervasive in clinical notes, counseling dialogues, and online mental health communities, and accurate recognition of these emotions is essential for clinical triage, risk assessment, and timely intervention. Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong generalization ability in emotion analysis tasks, their diagnostic reliability in high-stakes, context-intensive medical settings remains highly sensitive to prompt design. Moreover, existing methods face two key challenges: emotional comorbidity, in which multiple intertwined emotional states complicate prediction, and inefficient exploration of clinically relevant cues. To address these challenges, we propose APOLO (Automated Prompt Optimization for Linguistic Emotion Diagnosis), a framework that systematically explores a broader and finer-grained prompt space to improve diagnostic efficiency and robustness. APOLO formulates instruction refinement as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process and adopts a multi-agent collaboration mechanism involving Planner, Teacher, Critic, Student, and Target roles. Within this closed-loop framework, the Planner defines an optimization trajectory, while the Teacher-Critic-Student agents iteratively refine prompts to enhance reasoning stability and effectiveness, and the Target agent determines whether to continue optimization based on performance evaluation. Experimental results show that APOLO consistently improves diagnostic accuracy and robustness across domain-specific and stratified benchmarks, demonstrating a scalable and generalizable paradigm for trustworthy LLM applications in mental healthcare.

<summary><strong>AgentGC: Evolutionary Learning-based Lossless Compression for Genomics Data with LLM-driven Multiple Agent</strong> - Sun Hui, Ding Yanfeng, Huidong Ma, Chang Xu, Keyan Jin, Lizheng Zu, Cheng Zhong, xiaoguang Liu, Gang Wang, Wentong Cai - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.13559)</summary>

**Abstract:** Lossless compression has made significant advancements in Genomics Data (GD) storage, sharing and management. Current learning-based methods are non-evolvable with problems of low-level compression modeling, limited adaptability, and user-unfriendly interface. To this end, we propose AgentGC, the first evolutionary Agent-based GD Compressor, consisting of 3 layers with multi-agent named Leader and Worker. Specifically, the 1) User layer provides a user-friendly interface via Leader combined with LLM; 2) Cognitive layer, driven by the Leader, integrates LLM to consider joint optimization of algorithm-dataset-system, addressing the issues of low-level modeling and limited adaptability; and 3) Compression layer, headed by Worker, performs compression & decompression via a automated multi-knowledge learning-based compression framework. On top of AgentGC, we design 3 modes to support diverse scenarios: CP for compression-ratio priority, TP for throughput priority, and BM for balanced mode. Compared with 14 baselines on 9 datasets, the average compression ratios gains are 16.66%, 16.11%, and 16.33%, the throughput gains are 4.73x, 9.23x, and 9.15x, respectively.

<summary><strong>Motion-to-Response Content Generation via Multi-Agent AI System with Real-Time Safety Verification</strong> - HyeYoung Lee - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.13589)</summary>

**Abstract:** This paper proposes a multi-agent artificial intelligence system that generates response-oriented media content in real time based on audio-derived emotional signals. Unlike conventional speech emotion recognition studies that focus primarily on classification accuracy, our approach emphasizes the transformation of inferred emotional states into safe, age-appropriate, and controllable response content through a structured pipeline of specialized AI agents. The proposed system comprises four cooperative agents: (1) an Emotion Recognition Agent with CNN-based acoustic feature extraction, (2) a Response Policy Decision Agent for mapping emotions to response modes, (3) a Content Parameter Generation Agent for producing media control parameters, and (4) a Safety Verification Agent enforcing age-appropriateness and stimulation constraints. We introduce an explicit safety verification loop that filters generated content before output, ensuring compliance with predefined rules. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that the system achieves 73.2% emotion recognition accuracy, 89.4% response mode consistency, and 100% safety compliance while maintaining sub-100ms inference latency suitable for on-device deployment. The modular architecture enables interpretability and extensibility, making it applicable to child-adjacent media, therapeutic applications, and emotionally responsive smart devices.

**Abstract:** Writing effective rebuttals is a high-stakes task that demands more than linguistic fluency, as it requires precise alignment between reviewer intent and manuscript details. Current solutions typically treat this as a direct-to-text generation problem, suffering from hallucination, overlooked critiques, and a lack of verifiable grounding. To address these limitations, we introduce $\textbf{RebuttalAgent}$, the first multi-agents framework that reframes rebuttal generation as an evidence-centric planning task. Our system decomposes complex feedback into atomic concerns and dynamically constructs hybrid contexts by synthesizing compressed summaries with high-fidelity text while integrating an autonomous and on-demand external search module to resolve concerns requiring outside literature. By generating an inspectable response plan before drafting, $\textbf{RebuttalAgent}$ ensures that every argument is explicitly anchored in internal or external evidence. We validate our approach on the proposed $\textbf{RebuttalBench}$ and demonstrate that our pipeline outperforms strong baselines in coverage, faithfulness, and strategic coherence, offering a transparent and controllable assistant for the peer review process. Code will be released.

<summary><strong>LimAgents: Multi-Agent LLMs for Generating Research Limitations</strong> - Ibrahim Al Azher, Zhishuai Guo, Hamed Alhoori - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.11578)</summary>

**Abstract:** Identifying and articulating limitations is essential for transparent and rigorous scientific research. However, zero-shot large language models (LLMs) approach often produce superficial or general limitation statements (e.g., dataset bias or generalizability). They usually repeat limitations reported by authors without looking at deeper methodological issues and contextual gaps. This problem is made worse because many authors disclose only partial or trivial limitations. We propose LimAgents, a multi-agent LLM framework for generating substantive limitations. LimAgents integrates OpenReview comments and author-stated limitations to provide stronger ground truth. It also uses cited and citing papers to capture broader contextual weaknesses. In this setup, different agents have specific roles as sequential role: some extract explicit limitations, others analyze methodological gaps, some simulate the viewpoint of a peer reviewer, and a citation agent places the work within the larger body of literature. A Judge agent refines their outputs, and a Master agent consolidates them into a clear set. This structure allows for systematic identification of explicit, implicit, peer review-focused, and literature-informed limitations. Moreover, traditional NLP metrics like BLEU, ROUGE, and cosine similarity rely heavily on n-gram or embedding overlap. They often overlook semantically similar limitations. To address this, we introduce a pointwise evaluation protocol that uses an LLM-as-a-Judge to measure coverage more accurately. Experiments show that LimAgents substantially improve performance. The RAG + multi-agent GPT-4o mini configuration achieves a +15.51% coverage gain over zero-shot baselines, while the Llama 3 8B multi-agent setup yields a +4.41% improvement.

<summary><strong>Towards AGI A Pragmatic Approach Towards Self Evolving Agent</strong> - Indrajit Kar, Sammy Zonunpuia, Zonunfeli Ralte - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.11658)</summary>

**Abstract:** Large Language Model (LLM) based agents are powerful yet fundamentally static after deployment, lacking the ability to autonomously expand capabilities, generate new tools, or evolve their reasoning. This work introduces a hierarchical self-evolving multi-agent framework that integrates a Base LLM, an operational SLM agent, a Code-Generation LLM, and a Teacher-LLM to enable continuous adaptation. The workflow begins with the agent attempting a task using reasoning and existing tools; if unsuccessful, it escalates to tool synthesis through the Code-Gen LLM, and when failures persist, it triggers an evolution phase using Curriculum Learning (CL), Reward-Based Learning (RL), or Genetic Algorithm (GA) evolution. Using the TaskCraft dataset rich in hierarchical tasks, tool-use traces, and difficulty scaling we evaluate these paradigms. CL delivers fast recovery and strong generalization, RL excels on high-difficulty tasks, and GA offers high behavioral diversity. Across all settings, evolved agents outperform their originals, demonstrating robust, autonomous, self-improving agentic evolution.

<summary><strong>Semantic Caching and Intent-Driven Context Optimization for Multi-Agent Natural Language to Code Systems</strong> - Harmohit Singh - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.11687)</summary>

**Abstract:** We present a production-optimized multi-agent system designed to translate natural language queries into executable Python code for structured data analytics. Unlike systems that rely on expensive frontier models, our approach achieves high accuracy and cost efficiency through three key innovations: (1) a semantic caching system with LLM-based equivalence detection and structured adaptation hints that provides cache hit rates of 67% on production queries; (2) a dual-threshold decision mechanism that separates exact-match retrieval from reference-guided generation; and (3) an intent-driven dynamic prompt assembly system that reduces token consumption by 40-60% through table-aware context filtering. The system has been deployed in production for enterprise inventory management, processing over 10,000 queries with an average latency of 8.2 seconds and 94.3% semantic accuracy. We describe the architecture, present empirical results from production deployment, and discuss practical considerations for deploying LLM-based analytics systems at scale.

<summary><strong>LSTM-MAS: A Long Short-Term Memory Inspired Multi-Agent System for Long-Context Understanding</strong> - Yichen Jiang, Peng Ye, Jiakang Yuan, Chongjun Tu, Lei Bai, Tao Chen - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.11913)</summary>

**Abstract:** Effectively processing long contexts remains a fundamental yet unsolved challenge for large language models (LLMs). Existing single-LLM-based methods primarily reduce the context window or optimize the attention mechanism, but they often encounter additional computational costs or constrained expanded context length. While multi-agent-based frameworks can mitigate these limitations, they remain susceptible to the accumulation of errors and the propagation of hallucinations. In this work, we draw inspiration from the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture to design a Multi-Agent System called LSTM-MAS, emulating LSTM's hierarchical information flow and gated memory mechanisms for long-context understanding. Specifically, LSTM-MAS organizes agents in a chained architecture, where each node comprises a worker agent for segment-level comprehension, a filter agent for redundancy reduction, a judge agent for continuous error detection, and a manager agent for globally regulates information propagation and retention, analogous to LSTM and its input gate, forget gate, constant error carousel unit, and output gate. These novel designs enable controlled information transfer and selective long-term dependency modeling across textual segments, which can effectively avoid error accumulation and hallucination propagation. We conducted an extensive evaluation of our method. Compared with the previous best multi-agent approach, CoA, our model achieves improvements of 40.93%, 43.70%,121.57% and 33.12%, on NarrativeQA, Qasper, HotpotQA, and MuSiQue, respectively.

<summary><strong>Cooperative Multi-agent RL with Communication Constraints</strong> - Nuoya Xiong, Aarti Singh - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.12518)</summary>

**Abstract:** Cooperative MARL often assumes frequent access to global information in a data buffer, such as team rewards or other agents' actions, which is typically unrealistic in decentralized MARL systems due to high communication costs. When communication is limited, agents must rely on outdated information to estimate gradients and update their policies. A common approach to handle missing data is called importance sampling, in which we reweigh old data from a base policy to estimate gradients for the current policy. However, it quickly becomes unstable when the communication is limited (i.e. missing data probability is high), so that the base policy in importance sampling is outdated. To address this issue, we propose a technique called base policy prediction, which utilizes old gradients to predict the policy update and collect samples for a sequence of base policies, which reduces the gap between the base policy and the current policy. This approach enables effective learning with significantly fewer communication rounds, since the samples of predicted base policies could be collected within one communication round. Theoretically, we show that our algorithm converges to an $\varepsilon$-Nash equilibrium in potential games with only $O(\varepsilon^{-3/4})$ communication rounds and $O(poly(\max_i |A_i|)\varepsilon^{-11/4})$ samples, improving existing state-of-the-art results in communication cost, as well as sample complexity without the exponential dependence on the joint action space size. We also extend these results to general Markov Cooperative Games to find an agent-wise local maximum. Empirically, we test the base policy prediction algorithm in both simulated games and MAPPO for complex environments.

**Abstract:** Recent advances in LLM-based multi-agent systems (MAS) show that workflows composed of multiple LLM agents with distinct roles, tools, and communication patterns can outperform single-LLM baselines on complex tasks. However, most frameworks are homogeneous, where all agents share the same base LLM and differ only in prompts, tools, and positions in the workflow. This raises the question of whether such workflows can be simulated by a single agent through multi-turn conversations. We investigate this across seven benchmarks spanning coding, mathematics, general question answering, domain-specific reasoning, and real-world planning and tool use. Our results show that a single agent can reach the performance of homogeneous workflows with an efficiency advantage from KV cache reuse, and can even match the performance of an automatically optimized heterogeneous workflow. Building on this finding, we propose \textbf{OneFlow}, an algorithm that automatically tailors workflows for single-agent execution, reducing inference costs compared to existing automatic multi-agent design frameworks without trading off accuracy. These results position the single-LLM implementation of multi-agent workflows as a strong baseline for MAS research. We also note that single-LLM methods cannot capture heterogeneous workflows due to the lack of KV cache sharing across different LLMs, highlighting future opportunities in developing \textit{truly} heterogeneous multi-agent systems.

<summary><strong>Generative AI Agents for Controllable and Protected Content Creation</strong> - Haris Khan, Sadia Asif - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.12348)</summary>

**Abstract:** The proliferation of generative AI has transformed creative workflows, yet current systems face critical challenges in controllability and content protection. We propose a novel multi-agent framework that addresses both limitations through specialized agent roles and integrated watermarking mechanisms. Unlike existing multi-agent systems focused solely on generation quality, our approach uniquely combines controllable content synthesis with provenance protection during the generation process itself. The framework orchestrates Director/Planner, Generator, Reviewer, Integration, and Protection agents with human-in-the-loop feedback to ensure alignment with user intent while embedding imperceptible digital watermarks. We formalize the pipeline as a joint optimization objective unifying controllability, semantic alignment, and protection robustness. This work contributes to responsible generative AI by positioning multi-agent architectures as a solution for trustworthy creative workflows with built-in ownership tracking and content traceability.

<summary><strong>Semantic Fusion: Verifiable Alignment in Decentralized Multi-Agent Systems</strong> - Sofiya Zaichyk - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.12580)</summary>

**Abstract:** We present Semantic Fusion (SF), a formal framework for decentralized semantic coordination in multi-agent systems. SF allows agents to operate over scoped views of shared memory, propose structured updates, and maintain global coherence through local ontology-based validation and refresh without centralized control or explicit message passing. The central theoretical result is a bisimulation theorem showing that each agent's local execution is behaviorally equivalent to its projection of the global semantics, in both deterministic and probabilistic settings. This enables safety, liveness, and temporal properties to be verified locally and soundly lifted to the full system. SF supports agents whose update proposals vary across invocations, including those generated by learned or heuristic components, provided updates pass semantic validation before integration. We establish deterministic and probabilistic guarantees ensuring semantic alignment under asynchronous or degraded communication. To validate the model operationally, we implement a lightweight reference architecture that instantiates its core mechanisms. A 250-agent simulation evaluates these properties across over 11,000 validated updates, demonstrating convergence under probabilistic refresh, bounded communication, and resilience to agent failure. Together, these results show that Semantic Fusion can provide a formal and scalable basis for verifiable autonomy in decentralized systems.

<summary><strong>Communication Methods in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</strong> - Christoph Wittner - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.12886)</summary>

**Abstract:** Multi-agent reinforcement learning is a promising research area that extends established reinforcement learning approaches to problems formulated as multi-agent systems. Recently, a multitude of communication methods have been introduced to this field to address problems such as partially observable environments, non-stationarity, and exponentially growing action spaces. Communication further enables efficient cooperation among all agents interacting in an environment. This work aims at providing an overview of communication techniques in multi-agent reinforcement learning. By an in-depth analysis of 29 publications on this topic, the strengths and weaknesses of explicit, implicit, attention-based, graph-based, and hierarchical/role-based communication are evaluated. The results of this comparison show that there is no general, optimal communication framework for every problem. On the contrary, the choice of communication depends heavily on the problem at hand. The comparison also highlights the importance of communication methods with low computational overhead to enable scalability to environments where many agents interact. Finally, the paper discusses current research gaps, emphasizing the need for standardized benchmarking of system-level metrics and improved robustness under realistic communication conditions to enhance the real-world applicability of these approaches.

<summary><strong>OFA-MAS: One-for-All Multi-Agent System Topology Design based on Mixture-of-Experts Graph Generative Models</strong> - Shiyuan Li, Yixin Liu, Yu Zheng, Mei Li, Quoc Viet Hung Nguyen, Shirui Pan - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.12996)</summary>

**Abstract:** Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) offer a powerful paradigm for solving complex problems, yet their performance is critically dependent on the design of their underlying collaboration topology. As MAS become increasingly deployed in web services (e.g., search engines), designing adaptive topologies for diverse cross-domain user queries becomes essential. Current graph learning-based design methodologies often adhere to a "one-for-one" paradigm, where a specialized model is trained for each specific task domain. This approach suffers from poor generalization to unseen domains and fails to leverage shared structural knowledge across different tasks. To address this, we propose OFA-TAD, a one-for-all framework that generates adaptive collaboration graphs for any task described in natural language through a single universal model. Our approach integrates a Task-Aware Graph State Encoder (TAGSE) that filters task-relevant node information via sparse gating, and a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture that dynamically selects specialized sub-networks to drive node and edge prediction. We employ a three-stage training strategy: unconditional pre-training on canonical topologies for structural priors, large-scale conditional pre-training on LLM-generated datasets for task-topology mappings, and supervised fine-tuning on empirically validated graphs. Experiments across six diverse benchmarks show that OFA-TAD significantly outperforms specialized one-for-one models, generating highly adaptive MAS topologies. Code: this https URL.

<summary><strong>The Orchestration of Multi-Agent Systems: Architectures, Protocols, and Enterprise Adoption</strong> - Apoorva Adimulam, Rajesh Gupta, Sumit Kumar - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.13671)</summary>

**Abstract:** Orchestrated multi-agent systems represent the next stage in the evolution of artificial intelligence, where autonomous agents collaborate through structured coordination and communication to achieve complex, shared objectives. This paper consolidates and formalizes the technical composition of such systems, presenting a unified architectural framework that integrates planning, policy enforcement, state management, and quality operations into a coherent orchestration layer. Another primary contribution of this work is the in-depth technical delineation of two complementary communication protocols - the Model Context Protocol, which standardizes how agents access external tools and contextual data, and the Agent2Agent protocol, which governs peer coordination, negotiation, and delegation. Together, these protocols establish an interoperable communication substrate that enables scalable, auditable, and policy-compliant reasoning across distributed agent collectives. Beyond protocol design, the paper details how orchestration logic, governance frameworks, and observability mechanisms collectively sustain system coherence, transparency, and accountability. By synthesizing these elements into a cohesive technical blueprint, this paper provides comprehensive treatments of orchestrated multi-agent systems - bridging conceptual architectures with implementation-ready design principles for enterprise-scale AI ecosystems.

<summary><strong>LLMOrbit: A Circular Taxonomy of Large Language Models -From Scaling Walls to Agentic AI Systems</strong> - Badri N. Patro, Vijay S. Agneeswaran - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.14053)</summary>

**Abstract:** The field of artificial intelligence has undergone a revolution from foundational Transformer architectures to reasoning-capable systems approaching human-level performance. We present LLMOrbit, a comprehensive circular taxonomy navigating the landscape of large language models spanning 2019-2025. This survey examines over 50 models across 15 organizations through eight interconnected orbital dimensions, documenting architectural innovations, training methodologies, and efficiency patterns defining modern LLMs, generative AI, and agentic systems. We identify three critical crises: (1) data scarcity (9-27T tokens depleted by 2026-2028), (2) exponential cost growth ($3M to $300M+ in 5 years), and (3) unsustainable energy consumption (22x increase), establishing the scaling wall limiting brute-force approaches. Our analysis reveals six paradigms breaking this wall: (1) test-time compute (o1, DeepSeek-R1 achieve GPT-4 performance with 10x inference compute), (2) quantization (4-8x compression), (3) distributed edge computing (10x cost reduction), (4) model merging, (5) efficient training (ORPO reduces memory 50%), and (6) small specialized models (Phi-4 14B matches larger models). Three paradigm shifts emerge: (1) post-training gains (RLHF, GRPO, pure RL contribute substantially, DeepSeek-R1 achieving 79.8% MATH), (2) efficiency revolution (MoE routing 18x efficiency, Multi-head Latent Attention 8x KV cache compression enables GPT-4-level performance at <$0.30/M tokens), and (3) democratization (open-source Llama 3 88.6% MMLU surpasses GPT-4 86.4%). We provide insights into techniques (RLHF, PPO, DPO, GRPO, ORPO), trace evolution from passive generation to tool-using agents (ReAct, RAG, multi-agent systems), and analyze post-training innovations.

<summary><strong>EduThink4AI: Bridging Educational Critical Thinking and Multi-Agent LLM Systems</strong> - Xinmeng Hou, Ziting Chang, Zhouquan Lu, Chen Wenli, Liang Wan, Wei Feng, Hai Hu, Qing Guo - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.15015)</summary>

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential as educational tutoring agents, capable of tailoring hints, orchestrating lessons, and grading with near-human finesse across various academic domains. However, current LLM-based educational systems exhibit critical limitations in promoting genuine critical thinking, failing on over one-third of multi-hop questions with counterfactual premises, and remaining vulnerable to adversarial prompts that trigger biased or factually incorrect responses. To address these gaps, we propose \textbf{EDU-Prompting}, a novel multi-agent framework that bridges established educational critical thinking theories with LLM agent design to generate critical, bias-aware explanations while fostering diverse perspectives. Our systematic evaluation across theoretical benchmarks and practical college-level critical writing scenarios demonstrates that EDU-Prompting significantly enhances both content truthfulness and logical soundness in AI-generated educational responses. The framework's modular design enables seamless integration into existing prompting frameworks and educational applications, allowing practitioners to directly incorporate critical thinking catalysts that promote analytical reasoning and introduce multiple perspectives without requiring extensive system modifications.

<summary><strong>Convergence dynamics of Agent-to-Agent Interactions with Misaligned objectives</strong> - Romain Cosentino, Sarath Shekkizhar, Adam Earle - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.08710)</summary>

**Abstract:** We develop and analyze a theoretical framework for agent-to-agent interactions in a simplified in-context linear regression setting. In our model, each agent is instantiated as a single-layer transformer with linear self-attention (LSA) trained to implement gradient-descent-like updates on a quadratic regression objective from in-context examples. We then study the coupled dynamics when two such LSA agents alternately update from each other's outputs under potentially misaligned fixed objectives. Within this framework, we characterize the generation dynamics and show that misalignment leads to a biased equilibrium where neither agent reaches its target, with residual errors predictable from the objective gap and the prompt-induced geometry. We also characterize an adversarial regime where asymmetric convergence is possible: one agent reaches its objective exactly while inducing persistent bias in the other. We further contrast this fixed objective regime with an adaptive multi-agent setting, wherein a helper agent updates a turn-based objective to implement a Newton-like step for the main agent, eliminating the plateau and accelerating its convergence. Experiments with trained LSA agents, as well as black-box GPT-5-mini runs on in-context linear regression tasks, are consistent with our theoretical predictions within this simplified setting. We view our framework as a mechanistic framework that links prompt geometry and objective misalignment to stability, bias, and robustness, and as a stepping stone toward analyzing more realistic multi-agent LLM systems.

<summary><strong>Scene-Aware Vectorized Memory Multi-Agent Framework with Cross-Modal Differentiated Quantization VLMs for Visually Impaired Assistance</strong> - Xiangxiang Wang, Xuanyu Wang, YiJia Luo, Yongbin Yu, Manping Fan, Jingtao Zhang, Liyong Ren - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.18177)</summary>

**Abstract:** Visually impaired individuals face significant challenges in environmental perception. Traditional assistive technologies often lack adaptive intelligence, focusing on individual components rather than integrated systems. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer a promising path to richer, integrated understanding, their deployment is severely limited by substantial computational requirements, demanding dozens of gigabytes of memory. To address these gaps in computational efficiency and integrated design, this study proposes a dual technological innovation framework: a cross-modal differentiated quantization framework for VLMs and a scene-aware vectorized memory multi-agent system. The quantization framework implements differentiated strategies, reducing memory from 38GB to 11.3GB. The multi-agent system uses vectorized memory and perception-memory-reasoning workflows to provide environmental information beyond the current view, achieving 2.83-3.52s latency to initial speech output. Experiments show the quantized 19B-parameter model only experiences a 2.05% performance drop on MMBench and maintains 63.7 accuracy on OCR-VQA (original: 64.9), outperforming smaller models with equivalent memory. This research advances computational efficiency and assistive technology, offering comprehensive assistance in scene perception, text recognition, and navigation.

<summary><strong>Following the TRACE: A Structured Path to Empathetic Response Generation with Multi-Agent Models</strong> - Ziqi Liu, Ziyang Zhou, Yilin Li, Haiyang Zhang, Yangbin Chen - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.21849)</summary>

**Abstract:** Empathetic response generation is a crucial task for creating more human-like and supportive conversational agents. However, existing methods face a core trade-off between the analytical depth of specialized models and the generative fluency of Large Language Models (LLMs). To address this, we propose TRACE, Task-decomposed Reasoning for Affective Communication and Empathy, a novel framework that models empathy as a structured cognitive process by decomposing the task into a pipeline for analysis and synthesis. By building a comprehensive understanding before generation, TRACE unites deep analysis with expressive generation. Experimental results show that our framework significantly outperforms strong baselines in both automatic and LLM-based evaluations, confirming that our structured decomposition is a promising paradigm for creating more capable and interpretable empathetic agents. Our code is available at this https URL.

<summary><strong>A Cloud-based Multi-Agentic Workflow for Science</strong> - Anurag Acharya, Timothy Vega, Rizwan A. Ashraf, Anshu Sharma, Derek Parker, Robert Rallo - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.12607)</summary>

**Abstract:** As Large Language Models (LLMs) become ubiquitous across various scientific domains, their lack of ability to perform complex tasks like running simulations or to make complex decisions limits their utility. LLM-based agents bridge this gap due to their ability to call external resources and tools and thus are now rapidly gaining popularity. However, coming up with a workflow that can balance the models, cloud providers, and external resources is very challenging, making implementing an agentic system more of a hindrance than a help. In this work, we present a domain-agnostic, model-independent workflow for an agentic framework that can act as a scientific assistant while being run entirely on cloud. Built with a supervisor agent marshaling an array of agents with individual capabilities, our framework brings together straightforward tasks like literature review and data analysis with more complex ones like simulation runs. We describe the framework here in full, including a proof-of-concept system we built to accelerate the study of Catalysts, which is highly important in the field of Chemistry and Material Science. We report the cost to operate and use this framework, including the breakdown of the cost by services use. We also evaluate our system on a custom-curated synthetic benchmark and a popular Chemistry benchmark, and also perform expert validation of the system. The results show that our system is able to route the task to the correct agent 90% of the time and successfully complete the assigned task 97.5% of the time for the synthetic tasks and 91% of the time for real-world tasks, while still achieving better or comparable accuracy to most frontier models, showing that this is a viable framework for other scientific domains to replicate.

<summary><strong>Disagreement as Data: Reasoning Trace Analytics in Multi-Agent Systems</strong> - Elham Tajik, Conrad Borchers, Bahar Shahrokhian, Sebastian Simon, Ali Keramati, Sonika Pal, Sreecharan Sankaranarayanan - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.12618)</summary>

**Abstract:** Learning analytics researchers often analyze qualitative student data such as coded annotations or interview transcripts to understand learning processes. With the rise of generative AI, fully automated and human-AI workflows have emerged as promising methods for analysis. However, methodological standards to guide such workflows remain limited. In this study, we propose that reasoning traces generated by large language model (LLM) agents, especially within multi-agent systems, constitute a novel and rich form of process data to enhance interpretive practices in qualitative coding. We apply cosine similarity to LLM reasoning traces to systematically detect, quantify, and interpret disagreements among agents, reframing disagreement as a meaningful analytic signal. Analyzing nearly 10,000 instances of agent pairs coding human tutoring dialog segments, we show that LLM agents' semantic reasoning similarity robustly differentiates consensus from disagreement and correlates with human coding reliability. Qualitative analysis guided by this metric reveals nuanced instructional sub-functions within codes and opportunities for conceptual codebook refinement. By integrating quantitative similarity metrics with qualitative review, our method has the potential to improve and accelerate establishing inter-rater reliability during coding by surfacing interpretive ambiguity, especially when LLMs collaborate with humans. We discuss how reasoning-trace disagreements represent a valuable new class of analytic signals advancing methodological rigor and interpretive depth in educational research.

<summary><strong>Multimodal Multi-Agent Empowered Legal Judgment Prediction</strong> - Zhaolu Kang, Junhao Gong, Qingxi Chen, Hao Zhang, Jiaxin Liu, Rong Fu, Zhiyuan Feng, Yuan Wang, Simon Fong, Kaiyue Zhou - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.12815)</summary>

**Abstract:** Legal Judgment Prediction (LJP) aims to predict the outcomes of legal cases based on factual descriptions, serving as a fundamental task to advance the development of legal systems. Traditional methods often rely on statistical analyses or role-based simulations but face challenges with multiple allegations, diverse evidence, and lack adaptability. In this paper, we introduce JurisMMA, a novel framework for LJP that effectively decomposes trial tasks, standardizes processes, and organizes them into distinct stages. Furthermore, we build JurisMM, a large dataset with over 100,000 recent Chinese judicial records, including both text and multimodal video-text data, enabling comprehensive evaluation. Experiments on JurisMM and the benchmark LawBench validate our framework's effectiveness. These results indicate that our framework is effective not only for LJP but also for a broader range of legal applications, offering new perspectives for the development of future legal methods and datasets.

<summary><strong>The Bitter Lesson of Diffusion Language Models for Agentic Workflows: A Comprehensive Reality Check</strong> - Qingyu Lu, Liang Ding, Kanjian Zhang, Jinxia Zhang, Dacheng Tao - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.12979)</summary>

**Abstract:** The pursuit of real-time agentic interaction has driven interest in Diffusion-based Large Language Models (dLLMs) as alternatives to auto-regressive backbones, promising to break the sequential latency bottleneck. However, does such efficiency gains translate into effective agentic behavior? In this work, we present a comprehensive evaluation of dLLMs (e.g., LLaDA, Dream) across two distinct agentic paradigms: Embodied Agents (requiring long-horizon planning) and Tool-Calling Agents (requiring precise formatting). Contrary to the efficiency hype, our results on Agentboard and BFCL reveal a "bitter lesson": current dLLMs fail to serve as reliable agentic backbones, frequently leading to systematically failure. (1) In Embodied settings, dLLMs suffer repeated attempts, failing to branch under temporal feedback. (2) In Tool-Calling settings, dLLMs fail to maintain symbolic precision (e.g. strict JSON schemas) under diffusion noise. To assess the potential of dLLMs in agentic workflows, we introduce DiffuAgent, a multi-agent evaluation framework that integrates dLLMs as plug-and-play cognitive cores. Our analysis shows that dLLMs are effective in non-causal roles (e.g., memory summarization and tool selection) but require the incorporation of causal, precise, and logically grounded reasoning mechanisms into the denoising process to be viable for agentic tasks.

<summary><strong>MASCOT: Towards Multi-Agent Socio-Collaborative Companion Systems</strong> - Yiyang Wang, Yiqiao Jin, Alex Cabral, Josiah Hester - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.14230)</summary>

**Abstract:** Multi-agent systems (MAS) have recently emerged as promising socio-collaborative companions for emotional and cognitive support. However, these systems frequently suffer from persona collapse--where agents revert to generic, homogenized assistant behaviors--and social sycophancy, which produces redundant, non-constructive dialogue. We propose MASCOT, a generalizable framework for multi-perspective socio-collaborative companions. MASCOT introduces a novel bi-level optimization strategy to harmonize individual and collective behaviors: 1) Persona-Aware Behavioral Alignment, an RLAIF-driven pipeline that finetunes individual agents for strict persona fidelity to prevent identity loss; and 2) Collaborative Dialogue Optimization, a meta-policy guided by group-level rewards to ensure diverse and productive discourse. Extensive evaluations across psychological support and workplace domains demonstrate that MASCOT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving improvements of up to +14.1 in Persona Consistency and +10.6 in Social Contribution. Our framework provides a practical roadmap for engineering the next generation of socially intelligent multi-agent systems.

<summary><strong>Mitigating Cultural Bias in LLMs via Multi-Agent Cultural Debate</strong> - Qian Tan, Lei Jiang, Yuting Zeng, Shuoyang Ding, Xiaohua Xu - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.12091)</summary>

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) exhibit systematic Western-centric bias, yet whether prompting in non-Western languages (e.g., Chinese) can mitigate this remains understudied. Answering this question requires rigorous evaluation and effective mitigation, but existing approaches fall short on both fronts: evaluation methods force outputs into predefined cultural categories without a neutral option, while mitigation relies on expensive multi-cultural corpora or agent frameworks that use functional roles (e.g., Planner--Critique) lacking explicit cultural representation. To address these gaps, we introduce CEBiasBench, a Chinese--English bilingual benchmark, and Multi-Agent Vote (MAV), which enables explicit ``no bias'' judgments. Using this framework, we find that Chinese prompting merely shifts bias toward East Asian perspectives rather than eliminating it. To mitigate such persistent bias, we propose Multi-Agent Cultural Debate (MACD), a training-free framework that assigns agents distinct cultural personas and orchestrates deliberation via a "Seeking Common Ground while Reserving Differences" strategy. Experiments demonstrate that MACD achieves 57.6% average No Bias Rate evaluated by LLM-as-judge and 86.0% evaluated by MAV (vs. 47.6% and 69.0% baseline using GPT-4o as backbone) on CEBiasBench and generalizes to the Arabic CAMeL benchmark, confirming that explicit cultural representation in agent frameworks is essential for cross-cultural fairness.

<summary><strong>A Comprehensive Evaluation of LLM Reasoning: From Single-Model to Multi-Agent Paradigms</strong> - Yapeng Li, Jiakuo Yu, Zhixin Liu, Xinnan Liu, Jing Yu, Songze Li, Tonghua Su - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.13243)</summary>

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as reasoning systems, where reasoning paradigms - such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and multi-agent systems (MAS) - play a critical role, yet their relative effectiveness and cost-accuracy trade-offs remain poorly understood. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive and unified evaluation of reasoning paradigms, spanning direct single-model generation, CoT-augmented single-model reasoning, and representative MAS workflows, characterizing their reasoning performance across a diverse suite of closed-form benchmarks. Beyond overall performance, we probe role-specific capability demands in MAS using targeted role isolation analyses, and analyze cost-accuracy trade-offs to identify which MAS workflows offer a favorable balance between cost and accuracy, and which incur prohibitive overhead for marginal gains. We further introduce MIMeBench, a new open-ended benchmark that targets two foundational yet underexplored semantic capabilities - semantic abstraction and contrastive discrimination - thereby providing an alternative evaluation axis beyond closed-form accuracy and enabling fine-grained assessment of semantic competence that is difficult to capture with existing benchmarks. Our results show that increased structural complexity does not consistently lead to improved reasoning performance, with its benefits being highly dependent on the properties and suitability of the reasoning paradigm itself. The codes are released at this https URL.

**Abstract:** Robots are expected to play a major role in the future construction industry but face challenges due to high costs and difficulty adapting to dynamic tasks. This study explores the potential of foundation models to enhance the adaptability and generalizability of task planning in construction robots. Four models are proposed and implemented using lightweight, open-source large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs). These models include one single agent and three multi-agent teams that collaborate to create robot action plans. The models are evaluated across three construction roles: Painter, Safety Inspector, and Floor Tiling. Results show that the four-agent team outperforms the state-of-the-art GPT-4o in most metrics while being ten times more cost-effective. Additionally, teams with three and four agents demonstrate the improved generalizability. By discussing how agent behaviors influence outputs, this study enhances the understanding of AI teams and supports future research in diverse unstructured environments beyond construction.

<summary><strong>CAHC:A General Conflict-Aware Heuristic Caching Framework for Multi-Agent Path Finding</strong> - HT To, S Nguyen, NH Pham - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.12243)</summary>

**Abstract:** Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) algorithms, including those for car-like robots and grid-based scenarios, face significant computational challenges due to expensive heuristic calculations. Traditional heuristic caching assumes that the heuristic function depends only on the state, which is incorrect in constraint-based search algorithms (e.g., CBS, MAPF-LNS, MAP2) where constraints from conflict resolution make the search space context-dependent. We propose \textbf{CAHC} (Conflict-Aware Heuristic Caching), a general framework that caches heuristic values based on both state and relevant constraint context, addressing this fundamental limitation. We demonstrate CAHC through a case study on CL-CBS for car-like robots, where we combine conflict-aware caching with an adaptive hybrid heuristic in \textbf{CAR-CHASE} (Car-Like Robot Conflict-Aware Heuristic Adaptive Search Enhancement). Our key innovations are (1) a compact \emph{conflict fingerprint} that efficiently encodes which constraints affect a state's heuristic, (2) a domain-adaptable relevance filter using spatial, temporal, and geometric criteria, and (3) a modular architecture that enables systematic application to diverse MAPF algorithms. Experimental evaluation on 480 CL-CBS benchmark instances demonstrates a geometric mean speedup of 2.46$\times$ while maintaining solution optimality. The optimizations improve success rate from 77.9\% to 84.8\% (+6.9 percentage points), reduce total runtime by 70.1\%, and enable solving 33 additional instances. The framework's general architecture makes it applicable as a reliable optimization technique for MAP2, MAPF-LNS, and other constraint-based MAPF algorithms.

<summary><strong>Understanding Human-Multi-Agent Team Formation for Creative Work</strong> - Hyunseung Lim, Dasom Choi, Sooyohn Nam, Bogoan Kim, Hwajung Hong - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.13865)</summary>

**Abstract:** Team-based collaboration is a cornerstone of modern creative work. Recent advances in generative AI open possibilities for humans to collaborate with multiple AI agents in distinct roles to address complex creative workflows. Yet, how to form Human-Multi-Agent Teams (HMATs) is underexplored, especially given that inter-agent interactions increase complexity and the risk of unexpected behaviors. In this exploratory study, we aim to understand how to form HMATs for creative work using CrafTeam, a technology probe that allows users to form and collaborate with their teams. We conducted a study with 12 design practitioners, in which participants iterated through a three-step cycle: forming HMATs, ideating with their teams, and reflecting on their teams' ideation. Our findings reveal that while participants initially attempted autonomous team operations, they ultimately adopted team formations in which they directly orchestrated agents. We discuss design considerations for HMAT formation that humans can effectively orchestrate multiple agents.

<summary><strong>AI for Green Spaces: Leveraging Autonomous Navigation and Computer Vision for Park Litter Removal</strong> - Christopher Kao, Akhil Pathapati, James Davis - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.11876)</summary>

**Abstract:** There are 50 billion pieces of litter in the U.S. alone. Grass fields contribute to this problem because picnickers tend to leave trash on the field. We propose building a robot that can autonomously navigate, identify, and pick up trash in parks. To autonomously navigate the park, we used a Spanning Tree Coverage (STC) algorithm to generate a coverage path the robot could follow. To navigate this path, we successfully used Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) GPS, which provides a centimeter-level reading every second. For computer vision, we utilized the ResNet50 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which detects trash with 94.52% accuracy. For trash pickup, we tested multiple design concepts. We select a new pickup mechanism that specifically targets the trash we encounter on the field. Our solution achieved an overall success rate of 80%, demonstrating that autonomous trash pickup robots on grass fields are a viable solution.

Wilhelm, Yan Chen, Chris Brown, Eugenia H. Rho - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.12134)</summary>

**Abstract:** As AI assistance becomes embedded in programming practice, researchers have increasingly examined how these systems help learners generate code and work more efficiently. However, these studies often position AI as a replacement for human collaboration and overlook the social and learning-oriented aspects that emerge in collaborative programming. Our work introduces human-human-AI (HHAI) triadic programming, where an AI agent serves as an additional collaborator rather than a substitute for a human partner. Through a within-subjects study with 20 participants, we show that triadic collaboration enhances collaborative learning and social presence compared to the dyadic human-AI (HAI) baseline. In the triadic HHAI conditions, participants relied significantly less on AI-generated code in their work. This effect was strongest in the HHAI-shared condition, where participants had an increased sense of responsibility to understand AI suggestions before applying them. These findings demonstrate how triadic settings activate socially shared regulation of learning by making AI use visible and accountable to a human peer, suggesting that AI systems that augment rather than automate peer collaboration can better preserve the learning processes that collaborative programming relies on.

<summary><strong>Zero-Permission Manipulation: Can We Trust Large Multimodal Model Powered GUI Agents?</strong> - Yi Qian, Kunwei Qian, Xingbang He, Ligeng Chen, Jikang Zhang, Tiantai Zhang, Haiyang Wei, Linzhang Wang, Hao Wu, Bing Mao - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.12349)</summary>

**Abstract:** Large multimodal model powered GUI agents are emerging as high-privilege operators on mobile platforms, entrusted with perceiving screen content and injecting inputs. However, their design operates under the implicit assumption of Visual Atomicity: that the UI state remains invariant between observation and action. We demonstrate that this assumption is fundamentally invalid in Android, creating a critical attack surface.
We present Action Rebinding, a novel attack that allows a seemingly-benign app with zero dangerous permissions to rebind an agent's execution. By exploiting the inevitable observation-to-action gap inherent in the agent's reasoning pipeline, the attacker triggers foreground transitions to rebind the agent's planned action toward the target app. We weaponize the agent's task-recovery logic and Android's UI state preservation to orchestrate programmable, multi-step attack chains. Furthermore, we introduce an Intent Alignment Strategy (IAS) that manipulates the agent's reasoning process to rationalize UI states, enabling it to bypass verification gates (e.g., confirmation dialogs) that would otherwise be rejected.
We evaluate Action Rebinding Attacks on six widely-used Android GUI agents across 15 tasks. Our results demonstrate a 100% success rate for atomic action rebinding and the ability to reliably orchestrate multi-step attack chains. With IAS, the success rate in bypassing verification gates increases (from 0% to up to 100%). Notably, the attacker application requires no sensitive permissions and contains no privileged API calls, achieving a 0% detection rate across malware scanners (e.g., VirusTotal). Our findings reveal a fundamental architectural flaw in current agent-OS integration and provide critical insights for the secure design of future agent systems.

<summary><strong>From Prompts to Pavement: LMMs-based Agentic Behavior-Tree Generation Framework for Autonomous Vehicles</strong> - Omar Y. Goba, Ahmed Y. Gado, Catherine M. Elias, Ahmed Hussein - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.12358)</summary>

**Abstract:** Autonomous vehicles (AVs) require adaptive behavior planners to navigate unpredictable, real-world environments safely. Traditional behavior trees (BTs) offer structured decision logic but are inherently static and demand labor-intensive manual tuning, limiting their applicability at SAE Level 5 autonomy. This paper presents an agentic framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) and multi-modal vision models (LVMs) to generate and adapt BTs on the fly. A specialized Descriptor agent applies chain-of-symbols prompting to assess scene criticality, a Planner agent constructs high-level sub-goals via in-context learning, and a Generator agent synthesizes executable BT sub-trees in XML format. Integrated into a CARLA+Nav2 simulation, our system triggers only upon baseline BT failure, demonstrating successful navigation around unexpected obstacles (e.g., street blockage) with no human intervention. Compared to a static BT baseline, this approach is a proof-of-concept that extends to diverse driving scenarios.

This study investigates whether large language models (LLMs) can automate procedural case log documentation directly from free-text radiology reports. We evaluate multiple local and commercial LLMs under instruction-based and chain-of-thought prompting to extract structured procedural information from 414 curated interventional radiology reports authored by nine residents between 2018 and 2024. Model performance is assessed using sensitivity, specificity, and F1-score, alongside inference latency and token efficiency to estimate operational cost. Results show that both local and commercial models achieve strong extraction performance, with best F1-scores approaching 0.87, while exhibiting different trade-offs between speed and cost. Automation using LLMs has the potential to substantially reduce clerical burden for trainees and improve consistency in case logging. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of AI-assisted documentation in medical education and highlight the need for further validation across institutions and clinical workflows.

<summary><strong>Aligning Agentic World Models via Knowledgeable Experience Learning</strong> - Baochang Ren, Yunzhi Yao, Rui Sun, Shuofei Qiao, Ningyu Zhang, Huajun Chen - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.13247)</summary>

**Abstract:** Current Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit a critical modal disconnect: they possess vast semantic knowledge but lack the procedural grounding to respect the immutable laws of the physical world. Consequently, while these agents implicitly function as world models, their simulations often suffer from physical hallucinations-generating plans that are logically sound but physically unexecutable. Existing alignment strategies predominantly rely on resource-intensive training or fine-tuning, which attempt to compress dynamic environmental rules into static model parameters. However, such parametric encapsulation is inherently rigid, struggling to adapt to the open-ended variability of physical dynamics without continuous, costly retraining. To bridge this gap, we introduce WorldMind, a framework that autonomously constructs a symbolic World Knowledge Repository by synthesizing environmental feedback. Specifically, it unifies Process Experience to enforce physical feasibility via prediction errors and Goal Experience to guide task optimality through successful trajectories. Experiments on EB-ALFRED and EB-Habitat demonstrate that WorldMind achieves superior performance compared to baselines with remarkable cross-model and cross-environment transferability.

<summary><strong>Communication-Corruption Coupling and Verification in Cooperative Multi-Objective Bandits</strong> - Ming Shi - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.11924)</summary>

**Abstract:** We study cooperative stochastic multi-armed bandits with vector-valued rewards under adversarial corruption and limited verification. In each of $T$ rounds, each of $N$ agents selects an arm, the environment generates a clean reward vector, and an adversary perturbs the observed feedback subject to a global corruption budget $\Gamma$. Performance is measured by team regret under a coordinate-wise nondecreasing, $L$-Lipschitz scalarization $\phi$, covering linear, Chebyshev, and smooth monotone utilities. Our main contribution is a communication-corruption coupling: we show that a fixed environment-side budget $\Gamma$ can translate into an effective corruption level ranging from $\Gamma$ to $N\Gamma$, depending on whether agents share raw samples, sufficient statistics, or only arm recommendations. We formalize this via a protocol-induced multiplicity functional and prove regret bounds parameterized by the resulting effective corruption. As corollaries, raw-sample sharing can suffer an $N$-fold larger additive corruption penalty, whereas summary sharing and recommendation-only sharing preserve an unamplified $O(\Gamma)$ term and achieve centralized-rate team regret. We further establish information-theoretic limits, including an unavoidable additive $\Omega(\Gamma)$ penalty and a high-corruption regime $\Gamma=\Theta(NT)$ where sublinear regret is impossible without clean information. Finally, we characterize how a global budget $\nu$ of verified observations restores learnability. That is, verification is necessary in the high-corruption regime, and sufficient once it crosses the identification threshold, with certified sharing enabling the team's regret to become independent of $\Gamma$.

<summary><strong>TimeART: Towards Agentic Time Series Reasoning via Tool-Augmentation</strong> - Xingjian Wu, Junkai Lu, Zhengyu Li, Xiangfei Qiu, Jilin Hu, Chenjuan Guo, Christian S. Jensen, Bin Yang - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.13653)</summary>

**Abstract:** Time series data widely exist in real-world cyber-physical systems. Though analyzing and interpreting them contributes to significant values, e.g, disaster prediction and financial risk control, current workflows mainly rely on human data scientists, which requires significant labor costs and lacks automation. To tackle this, we introduce TimeART, a framework fusing the analytical capability of strong out-of-the-box tools and the reasoning capability of Large Language Models (LLMs), which serves as a fully agentic data scientist for Time Series Question Answering (TSQA). To teach the LLM-based Time Series Reasoning Models (TSRMs) strategic tool-use, we also collect a 100k expert trajectory corpus called TimeToolBench. To enhance TSRMs' generalization capability, we then devise a four-stage training strategy, which boosts TSRMs through learning from their own early experiences and self-reflections. Experimentally, we train an 8B TSRM on TimeToolBench and equip it with the TimeART framework, and it achieves consistent state-of-the-art performance on multiple TSQA tasks, which pioneers a novel approach towards agentic time series reasoning.

<summary><strong>Quantum Kernel Machine Learning for Autonomous Materials Science</strong> - Felix Adams, Daiwei Zhu, David W. Steuerman, A. Gilad Kusne, Ichiro Takeuchi - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.11775)</summary>

**Abstract:** Autonomous materials science, where active learning is used to navigate large compositional phase space, has emerged as a powerful vehicle to rapidly explore new materials. A crucial aspect of autonomous materials science is exploring new materials using as little data as possible. Gaussian process-based active learning allows effective charting of multi-dimensional parameter space with a limited number of training data, and thus is a common algorithmic choice for autonomous materials science. An integral part of the autonomous workflow is the application of kernel functions for quantifying similarities among measured data points. A recent theoretical breakthrough has shown that quantum kernel models can achieve similar performance with less training data than classical models. This signals the possible advantage of applying quantum kernel machine learning to autonomous materials discovery. In this work, we compare quantum and classical kernels for their utility in sequential phase space navigation for autonomous materials science. Specifically, we compute a quantum kernel and several classical kernels for x-ray diffraction patterns taken from an Fe-Ga-Pd ternary composition spread library. We conduct our study on both IonQ's Aria trapped ion quantum computer hardware and the corresponding classical noisy simulator. We experimentally verify that a quantum kernel model can outperform some classical kernel models. The results highlight the potential of quantum kernel machine learning methods for accelerating materials discovery and suggest complex x-ray diffraction data is a candidate for robust quantum kernel model advantage.

<summary><strong>LLM-VLM Fusion Framework for Autonomous Maritime Port Inspection using a Heterogeneous UAV-USV System</strong> - Muhayy Ud Din, Waseem Akram, Ahsan B. Bakht, Irfan Hussain - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.13096)</summary>

**Abstract:** Maritime port inspection plays a critical role in ensuring safety, regulatory compliance, and operational efficiency in complex maritime environments. However, existing inspection methods often rely on manual operations and conventional computer vision techniques that lack scalability and contextual understanding. This study introduces a novel integrated engineering framework that utilizes the synergy between Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) to enable autonomous maritime port inspection using cooperative aerial and surface robotic platforms. The proposed framework replaces traditional state-machine mission planners with LLM-driven symbolic planning and improved perception pipelines through VLM-based semantic inspection, enabling context-aware and adaptive monitoring. The LLM module translates natural language mission instructions into executable symbolic plans with dependency graphs that encode operational constraints and ensure safe UAV-USV coordination. Meanwhile, the VLM module performs real-time semantic inspection and compliance assessment, generating structured reports with contextual reasoning. The framework was validated using the extended MBZIRC Maritime Simulator with realistic port infrastructure and further assessed through real-world robotic inspection trials. The lightweight on-board design ensures suitability for resource-constrained maritime platforms, advancing the development of intelligent, autonomous inspection systems.

<summary><strong>Efficient Coordination with the System-Level Shared State: An Embodied-AI Native Modular Framework</strong> - Yixuan Deng, Tongrun Wu, Donghao Wu, Zeyu Wei, Jiayuan Wang, Zhenglong Sun, Yuqing Tang, Xiaoqiang Ji - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.13945)</summary>

**Abstract:** As Embodied AI systems move from research prototypes to real world deployments, they tend to evolve rapidly while remaining reliable under workload changes and partial failures. In practice, many deployments are only partially decoupled: middleware moves messages, but shared context and feedback semantics are implicit, causing interface drift, cross-module interference, and brittle recovery at scale. We present ANCHOR, a modular framework that makes decoupling and robustness explicit system-level primitives. ANCHOR separates (i) Canonical Records, an evolvable contract for the standardized shared state, from (ii) a communication bus for many-to-many dissemination and feedback-oriented coordination, forming an inspectable end-to-end loop. We validate closed-loop feasibility on a de-identified workflow instantiation, characterize latency distributions under varying payload sizes and publish rates, and demonstrate automatic stream resumption after hard crashes and restarts even with shared-memory loss. Overall, ANCHOR turns ad-hoc integration glue into explicit contracts, enabling controlled degradation under load and self-healing recovery for scalable deployment of closed-loop AI systems.

**Abstract:** We present the design of an autoregressive active inference agent in the form of message passing on a factor graph. Expected free energy is derived and distributed across a planning graph. The proposed agent is validated on a robot navigation task, demonstrating exploration and exploitation in a continuous-valued observation space with bounded continuous-valued actions. Compared to a classical optimal controller, the agent modulates action based on predictive uncertainty, arriving later but with a better model of the robot's dynamics.

<summary><strong>Exploring Learners' Expectations and Engagement When Collaborating with Constructively Controversial Peer Agents</strong> - Thitaree Tanprasert, Young-ho Kim, Sidney Fels, Dongwook Yoon - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.13479)</summary>

**Abstract:** Peer agents can supplement real-time collaborative learning in asynchronous online courses. Constructive Controversy (CC) theory suggests that humans deepen their understanding of a topic by confronting and resolving controversies. This study explores whether CC's benefits apply to LLM-based peer agents, focusing on the impact of agents' disputatious behaviors and disclosure of agents' behavior designs on the learning process. In our mixed-method study (n=144), we compare LLMs that follow detailed CC guidelines (regulated) to those guided by broader goals (unregulated) and examine the effects of disclosing the agents' design to users (transparent vs. opaque). Findings show that learners' values influence their agent interaction: those valuing control appreciate unregulated agents' willingness to cease push-back upon request, while those valuing intellectual challenges favor regulated agents for stimulating creativity. Additionally, design transparency lowers learners' perception of agents' abilities. Our findings lay the foundation for designing effective collaborative peer agents in isolated educational settings.

<summary><strong>Risk-Aware Human-in-the-Loop Framework with Adaptive Intrusion Response for Autonomous Vehicles</strong> - Dawood Wasif, Terrence J. Moore, Seunghyun Yoon, Hyuk Lim, Dan Dongseong Kim, Frederica F. Nelson, Jin-Hee Cho - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.11781)</summary>

**Abstract:** Autonomous vehicles must remain safe and effective when encountering rare long-tailed scenarios or cyber-physical intrusions during driving. We present RAIL, a risk-aware human-in-the-loop framework that turns heterogeneous runtime signals into calibrated control adaptations and focused learning. RAIL fuses three cues (curvature actuation integrity, time-to-collision proximity, and observation-shift consistency) into an Intrusion Risk Score (IRS) via a weighted Noisy-OR. When IRS exceeds a threshold, actions are blended with a cue-specific shield using a learned authority, while human override remains available; when risk is low, the nominal policy executes. A contextual bandit arbitrates among shields based on the cue vector, improving mitigation choices online. RAIL couples Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) with risk-prioritized replay and dual rewards so that takeovers and near misses steer learning while nominal behavior remains covered. On MetaDrive, RAIL achieves a Test Return (TR) of 360.65, a Test Success Rate (TSR) of 0.85, a Test Safety Violation (TSV) of 0.75, and a Disturbance Rate (DR) of 0.0027, while logging only 29.07 training safety violations, outperforming RL, safe RL, offline/imitation learning, and prior HITL baselines. Under Controller Area Network (CAN) injection and LiDAR spoofing attacks, it improves Success Rate (SR) to 0.68 and 0.80, lowers the Disengagement Rate under Attack (DRA) to 0.37 and 0.03, and reduces the Attack Success Rate (ASR) to 0.34 and 0.11. In CARLA, RAIL attains a TR of 1609.70 and TSR of 0.41 with only 8000 steps.

<summary><strong>Optimal Power Allocation and Sub-Optimal Channel Assignment for Downlink NOMA Systems Using Deep Reinforcement Learning</strong> - WooSeok Kim, Jeonghoon Lee, Sangho Kim, Taesun An, WonMin Lee, Dowon Kim, Kyungseop Shin - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.12242)</summary>

**Abstract:** In recent years, Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) system has emerged as a promising candidate for multiple access frameworks due to the evolution of deep machine learning, trying to incorporate deep machine learning into the NOMA system. The main motivation for such active studies is the growing need to optimize the utilization of network resources as the expansion of the internet of things (IoT) caused a scarcity of network resources. The NOMA addresses this need by power multiplexing, allowing multiple users to access the network simultaneously. Nevertheless, the NOMA system has few limitations. Several works have proposed to mitigate this, including the optimization of power allocation known as joint resource allocation(JRA) method, and integration of the JRA method and deep reinforcement learning (JRA-DRL). Despite this, the channel assignment problem remains unclear and requires further investigation. In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning framework incorporating replay memory with an on-policy algorithm, allocating network resources in a NOMA system to generalize the learning. Also, we provide extensive simulations to evaluate the effects of varying the learning rate, batch size, type of model, and the number of features in the state.

**Abstract:** While large language models (LLMs) have shown to perform well on monolingual mathematical and commonsense reasoning, they remain unreliable for multilingual medical reasoning applications, hindering their deployment in multilingual healthcare settings. We address this by first introducing CUREMED-BENCH, a high-quality multilingual medical reasoning dataset with open-ended reasoning queries with a single verifiable answer, spanning thirteen languages, including underrepresented languages such as Amharic, Yoruba, and Swahili. Building on this dataset, we propose CURE-MED, a curriculum-informed reinforcement learning framework that integrates code-switching-aware supervised fine-tuning and Group Relative Policy Optimization to jointly improve logical correctness and language stability. Across thirteen languages, our approach consistently outperforms strong baselines and scales effectively, achieving 85.21% language consistency and 54.35% logical correctness at 7B parameters, and 94.96% language consistency and 70.04% logical correctness at 32B parameters. These results support reliable and equitable multilingual medical reasoning in LLMs. The code and dataset are available at this https URL

**Abstract:** Personalized digital health support requires long-horizon, cross-dimensional reasoning over heterogeneous lifestyle signals, and recent advances in mobile sensing and large language models (LLMs) make such support increasingly feasible. However, the capabilities of current LLMs in this setting remain unclear due to the lack of systematic benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce LifeAgentBench, a large-scale QA benchmark for long-horizon, cross-dimensional, and multi-user lifestyle health reasoning, containing 22,573 questions spanning from basic retrieval to complex reasoning. We release an extensible benchmark construction pipeline and a standardized evaluation protocol to enable reliable and scalable assessment of LLM-based health assistants. We then systematically evaluate 11 leading LLMs on LifeAgentBench and identify key bottlenecks in long-horizon aggregation and cross-dimensional reasoning. Motivated by these findings, we propose LifeAgent as a strong baseline agent for health assistant that integrates multi-step evidence retrieval with deterministic aggregation, achieving significant improvements compared with two widely used baselines. Case studies further demonstrate its potential in realistic daily-life scenarios. The benchmark is publicly available at this https URL.

<summary><strong>Toward Efficient Agents: Memory, Tool learning, and Planning</strong> - Xiaofang Yang, Lijun Li, Heng Zhou, Tong Zhu, Xiaoye Qu, Yuchen Fan, Qianshan Wei, Rui Ye, Li Kang, Yiran Qin, Zhiqiang Kou, Daizong Liu, Qi Li, Ning Ding, Siheng Chen, Jing Shao - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.14192)</summary>

**Abstract:** Recent years have witnessed increasing interest in extending large language models into agentic systems. While the effectiveness of agents has continued to improve, efficiency, which is crucial for real-world deployment, has often been overlooked. This paper therefore investigates efficiency from three core components of agents: memory, tool learning, and planning, considering costs such as latency, tokens, steps, etc. Aimed at conducting comprehensive research addressing the efficiency of the agentic system itself, we review a broad range of recent approaches that differ in implementation yet frequently converge on shared high-level principles including but not limited to bounding context via compression and management, designing reinforcement learning rewards to minimize tool invocation, and employing controlled search mechanisms to enhance efficiency, which we discuss in detail. Accordingly, we characterize efficiency in two complementary ways: comparing effectiveness under a fixed cost budget, and comparing cost at a comparable level of effectiveness. This trade-off can also be viewed through the Pareto frontier between effectiveness and cost. From this perspective, we also examine efficiency oriented benchmarks by summarizing evaluation protocols for these components and consolidating commonly reported efficiency metrics from both benchmark and methodological studies. Moreover, we discuss the key challenges and future directions, with the goal of providing promising insights.

<summary><strong>Bit-politeia: An AI Agent Community in Blockchain</strong> - Xing Yang - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.11583)</summary>

**Abstract:** Current resource allocation paradigms, particularly in academic evaluation, are constrained by inherent limitations such as the Matthew Effect, reward hacking driven by Goodhart's Law, and the trade-off between efficiency and fairness. To address these challenges, this paper proposes "Bit-politeia", an AI agent community on blockchain designed to construct a fair, efficient, and sustainable resource allocation system. In this virtual community, residents interact via AI agents serving as their exclusive proxies, which are optimized for impartiality and value alignment. The community adopts a "clustered grouping + hierarchical architecture" that integrates democratic centralism to balance decision-making efficiency and trust mechanisms. Agents engage through casual chat and deliberative interactions to evaluate research outputs and distribute a virtual currency as rewards. This incentive mechanism aims to achieve incentive compatibility through consensus-driven evaluation, while blockchain technology ensures immutable records of all transactions and reputation data. By leveraging AI for objective assessment and decentralized verification, Bit-politeia minimizes human bias and mitigates resource centralization issues found in traditional peer review. The proposed framework provides a novel pathway for optimizing scientific innovation through a fair and automated resource configuration process.

<summary><strong>Hindsight Preference Replay Improves Preference-Conditioned Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning</strong> - Jonaid Shianifar, Michael Schukat, Karl Mason - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.11604)</summary>

**Abstract:** Multi-objective reinforcement learning (MORL) enables agents to optimize vector-valued rewards while respecting user preferences. CAPQL, a preference-conditioned actor-critic method, achieves this by conditioning on weight vectors w and restricts data usage to the specific preferences under which it was collected, leaving off-policy data from other preferences unused. We introduce Hindsight Preference Replay (HPR), a simple and general replay augmentation strategy that retroactively relabels stored transitions with alternative preferences. This densifies supervision across the preference simplex without altering the CAPQL architecture or loss functions. Evaluated on six MO-Gymnasium locomotion tasks at a fixed 300000-step budget using expected utility (EUM), hypervolume (HV), and sparsity, HPR-CAPQL improves HV in five of six environments and EUM in four of six. On mo-humanoid-v5, for instance, EUM rises from $323\!\pm\!125$ to $1613\!\pm\!464$ and HV from 0.52M to 9.63M, with strong statistical support. mo-halfcheetah-v5 remains a challenging exception where CAPQL attains higher HV at comparable EUM. We report final summaries and Pareto-front visualizations across all tasks.

<summary><strong>Reinforcement Learning for Dynamic Workflow Optimization in CI/CD Pipelines</strong> - Aniket Abhishek Soni, Milan Parikh, Rashi Nimesh Kumar Dhenia, Jubin Abhishek Soni, Ayush Raj Jha, Sneja Mitinbhai Shah - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.11647)</summary>

**Abstract:** Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines are central to modern software delivery, yet their static workflows often introduce inefficiencies as systems scale. This paper proposes a reinforcement learning (RL) based approach to dynamically optimize CI/CD pipeline workflows. The pipeline is modeled as a Markov Decision Process, and an RL agent is trained to make runtime decisions such as selecting full, partial, or no test execution in order to maximize throughput while minimizing testing overhead.
A configurable CI/CD simulation environment is developed to evaluate the approach across build, test, and deploy stages. Experimental results show that the RL optimized pipeline achieves up to a 30 percent improvement in throughput and approximately a 25 percent reduction in test execution time compared to static baselines, while maintaining a defect miss rate below 5 percent. The agent learns to selectively skip or abbreviate tests for low risk commits, accelerating feedback cycles without significantly increasing failure risk.
These results demonstrate the potential of reinforcement learning to enable adaptive and intelligent DevOps workflows, providing a practical pathway toward more efficient, resilient, and sustainable CI/CD automation.

<summary><strong>Speculative Sampling with Reinforcement Learning</strong> - Chenan Wang, Daniel H. Shi, Haipeng Chen - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.12212)</summary>

**Abstract:** Inference time latency has remained an open challenge for real world applications of large language models (LLMs). State-of-the-art (SOTA) speculative sampling (SpS) methods for LLMs, like EAGLE-3, use tree-based drafting to explore multiple candidate continuations in parallel. However, the hyperparameters controlling the tree structure are static, which limits flexibility and efficiency across diverse contexts and domains. We introduce Reinforcement learning for Speculative Sampling (Re-SpS), the first reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework for draft tree hyperparameter optimization. Re-SpS dynamically adjusts draft tree hyperparameters in real-time, learning context-aware policies that maximize generation speed by balancing speculative aggression with computational overhead. It leverages efficient state representations from target model hidden states and introduces multi-step action persistence for better context modeling. Evaluation results across five diverse benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements over the SOTA method EAGLE-3, achieving up to 5.45$\times$ speedup over the backbone LLM and up to 1.12$\times$ speedup compared to EAGLE-3 across five diverse benchmarks, with no loss in output fidelity.

<summary><strong>Improved Bug Localization with AI Agents Leveraging Hypothesis and Dynamic Cognition</strong> - Asif Mohammed Samir, Mohammad Masudur Rahman - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.12522)</summary>

**Abstract:** Software bugs cost technology providers (e.g., AT&T) billions annually and cause developers to spend roughly 50% of their time on bug resolution. Traditional methods for bug localization often analyze the suspiciousness of code components (e.g., methods, documents) in isolation, overlooking their connections with other components in the codebase. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and agentic AI techniques have shown strong potential for code understanding, but still lack causal reasoning during code exploration and struggle to manage growing context effectively, limiting their capability. In this paper, we present a novel agentic technique for bug localization -- CogniGent -- that overcomes the limitations above by leveraging multiple AI agents capable of causal reasoning, call-graph-based root cause analysis and context engineering. It emulates developers-inspired debugging practices (a.k.a., dynamic cognitive debugging) and conducts hypothesis testing to support bug localization. We evaluate CogniGent on a curated dataset of 591 bug reports using three widely adopted performance metrics and compare it against six established baselines from the literature. Experimental results show that our technique consistently outperformed existing traditional and LLM-based techniques, achieving MAP improvements of 23.33-38.57% at the document and method levels. Similar gains were observed in MRR, with increases of 25.14-53.74% at both granularity levels. Statistical significance tests also confirm the superiority of our technique. By addressing the reasoning, dependency, and context limitations, CogniGent advances the state of bug localization, bridging human-like cognition with agentic automation for improved performance.

<summary><strong>Improving Low-Resource Machine Translation via Round-Trip Reinforcement Learning</strong> - Ahmed Attia, Alham Fikri - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.12535)</summary>

**Abstract:** Low-resource machine translation (MT) has gained increasing attention as parallel data from low-resource language communities is collected, but many potential methods for improving low-resource MT remain unexplored. We investigate a self-supervised reinforcement-learning-based fine-tuning for translation in low-resource settings using round-trip bootstrapping with the No Language Left Behind (NLLB) family of models. Our approach translates English into a target low-resource language and then back into English, using a combination of chrF++ and BLEU as the reward function on the reconstructed English sentences. Using the NLLB-MD dataset, we evaluate both the 600M and 1.3B parameter NLLB models and observe consistent improvements for the following languages: Central Aymara, Friulian, Wolof and Russian. Qualitative inspection of translation outputs indicates increased fluency and semantic fidelity. We argue that our method can further benefit from scale, enabling models to increasingly leverage their pretrained knowledge and continue self-improving.

<summary><strong>Communication-Free Collective Navigation for a Swarm of UAVs via LiDAR-Based Deep Reinforcement Learning</strong> - Myong-Yol Choi, Hankyoul Ko, Hanse Cho, Changseung Kim, Seunghwan Kim, Jaemin Seo, Hyondong Oh - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.13657)</summary>

**Abstract:** This paper presents a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based controller for collective navigation of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms in communication-denied environments, enabling robust operation in complex, obstacle-rich environments. Inspired by biological swarms where informed individuals guide groups without explicit communication, we employ an implicit leader-follower framework. In this paradigm, only the leader possesses goal information, while follower UAVs learn robust policies using only onboard LiDAR sensing, without requiring any inter-agent communication or leader identification. Our system utilizes LiDAR point clustering and an extended Kalman filter for stable neighbor tracking, providing reliable perception independent of external positioning systems. The core of our approach is a DRL controller, trained in GPU-accelerated Nvidia Isaac Sim, that enables followers to learn complex emergent behaviors - balancing flocking and obstacle avoidance - using only local perception. This allows the swarm to implicitly follow the leader while robustly addressing perceptual challenges such as occlusion and limited field-of-view. The robustness and sim-to-real transfer of our approach are confirmed through extensive simulations and challenging real-world experiments with a swarm of five UAVs, which successfully demonstrated collective navigation across diverse indoor and outdoor environments without any communication or external localization.

**Abstract:** Most of the traditional Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) depend on strict matching using keywords, where candidates that are highly qualified are many times disqualified because of minor semantic differences. In this article, the two-stage process of developing a more comprehensive resume assessment system based on a small language model that is trained with fewer than 600M parameters is introduced and fine-tuned by using GRPO with a uniquely designed reward function. The initial stage is Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), which is used to create a strong base model with the ability to perceive resumes beyond superficial overlap of keywords. This SFT model is further optimized in the second step with Reinforcement Learning (RL) via GRPO with the help of multi-component-based rewarding, which will not be considered as a commission of tokens matching. In the initial RL experiments, we found a severe difficulty in the shape of reward hacking: overly aggressive penalty terms resulted in unstable training dynamics and prohibitively negative model behavior. This was solved by trial-and-error refinement of the reward and careful training hyperparameter tuning, which led to a stable and controlled process of gentle polishing. The GRPO-refined model shows high real-life performance, as it shows an accuracy of 91% on unseen data used for testing. It has a high recall of 0.85 on the SELECTED class with a perfect precision of 1.0, which highlights its high reliability for identifying qualified applicants. These findings demonstrate that an appropriately structured two-step fine-tuning pipeline can effectively be used to transfer a small language model into human-like candidate evaluation, surpassing the shortcomings of both traditional ATS systems and unrefined uses of reinforcement learning.

**Abstract:** Deep Research Agents are increasingly used for automated survey generation. However, whether they can write surveys like human experts remains unclear. Existing benchmarks focus on fluency or citation accuracy, but none evaluates the core capabilities: retrieving essential papers and organizing them into coherent knowledge structures. We introduce TaxoBench, a diagnostic benchmark derived from 72 highly-cited computer science surveys. We manually extract expert-authored taxonomy trees containing 3,815 precisely categorized citations as ground truth. Our benchmark supports two evaluation modes: Deep Research mode tests end-to-end retrieval and organization given only a topic, while Bottom-Up mode isolates structuring capability by providing the exact papers human experts used. We evaluate 7 leading Deep Research agents and 12 frontier LLMs. Results reveal a dual bottleneck: the best agent recalls only 20.9% of expert-selected papers, and even with perfect input, the best model achieves only 0.31 ARI in organization. Current deep research agents remain far from expert-level survey writing. Our benchmark is publicly available at this https URL.

<summary><strong>Graph Reasoning Paradigm: Structured and Symbolic Reasoning with Topology-Aware Reinforcement Learning for Large Language Models</strong> - Runxuan Liu, Xianhao Ou, Xinyan Ma, Jiyuan Wang, Jiafeng Liang, Jiaqi Li, Tao He, Zheng Chu, Rongchuan Mu, Zekun Wang, Baoxin Wang, Dayong Wu, Ming Liu, Shijin Wang, Guoping Hu, Bing Qin - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.12995)</summary>

**Abstract:** Long Chain-of-Thought (LCoT), achieved by Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), has proven effective in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, reasoning in current LLMs is primarily generated as plain text, where performing semantic evaluation on such unstructured data creates a computational bottleneck during training. Despite RLVR-based optimization, existing methods still suffer from coarse-grained supervision, reward hacking, high training costs, and poor generalization. To address these issues, we propose the Graph Reasoning Paradigm (GRP), which realizes structured and symbolic reasoning, implemented via graph-structured representations with step-level cognitive labels. Building upon GRP, we further design Process-Aware Stratified Clipping Group Relative Policy Optimization (PASC-GRPO), which leverages structured evaluation to replace semantic evaluation, achieves process-aware verification through graph-structured outcome rewards, and mitigates reward hacking via stratified clipping advantage estimation. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements across mathematical reasoning and code generation tasks. Data, models, and code will be released later.

<summary><strong>Dr. Assistant: Enhancing Clinical Diagnostic Inquiry via Structured Diagnostic Reasoning Data and Reinforcement Learning</strong> - Yue Guo, Fanfu Wang, Jianwei Lv, Xincheng Shi, Yuchen Li, Youya Wang, Yunsheng Zeng, Yujing Liu, Yunhao Qiao, Gen Li, Junfeng Wang, Bo Yuan - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.13690)</summary>

**Abstract:** Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSSs) provide reasoning and inquiry guidance for physicians, yet they face notable challenges, including high maintenance costs and low generalization capability. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely adopted in healthcare due to their extensive knowledge reserves, retrieval, and communication capabilities. While LLMs show promise and excel at medical benchmarks, their diagnostic reasoning and inquiry skills are constrained. To mitigate this issue, we propose (1) Clinical Diagnostic Reasoning Data (CDRD) structure to capture abstract clinical reasoning logic, and a pipeline for its construction, and (2) the Dr. Assistant, a clinical diagnostic model equipped with clinical reasoning and inquiry skills. Its training involves a two-stage process: SFT, followed by RL with a tailored reward function. We also introduce a benchmark to evaluate both diagnostic reasoning and inquiry. Our experiments demonstrate that the Dr. Assistant outperforms open-source models and achieves competitive performance to closed-source models, providing an effective solution for clinical diagnostic inquiry guidance.

<summary><strong>PAIR-SAFE: A Paired-Agent Approach for Runtime Auditing and Refining AI-Mediated Mental Health Support</strong> - Jiwon Kim, Violeta J. Rodriguez, Dong Whi Yoo, Eshwar Chandrasekharan, Koustuv Saha - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.12754)</summary>

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for mental health support, yet they can produce responses that are overly directive, inconsistent, or clinically misaligned, particularly in sensitive or high-risk contexts. Existing approaches to mitigating these risks largely rely on implicit alignment through training or prompting, offering limited transparency and runtime accountability. We introduce PAIR-SAFE, a paired-agent framework for auditing and refining AI-generated mental health support that integrates a Responder agent with a supervisory Judge agent grounded in the clinically validated Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity (MITI-4) framework. The Judgeaudits each response and provides structuredALLOW or REVISE decisions that guide runtime response refinement. We simulate counseling interactions using a support-seeker simulator derived from human-annotated motivational interviewing data. We find that Judge-supervised interactions show significant improvements in key MITI dimensions, including Partnership, Seek Collaboration, and overall Relational quality. Our quantitative findings are supported by qualitative expert evaluation, which further highlights the nuances of runtime supervision. Together, our results reveal that such pairedagent approach can provide clinically grounded auditing and refinement for AI-assisted conversational mental health support.

<summary><strong>Jet-RL: Enabling On-Policy FP8 Reinforcement Learning with Unified Training and Rollout Precision Flow</strong> - Haocheng Xi, Charlie Ruan, Peiyuan Liao, Yujun Lin, Han Cai, Yilong Zhao, Shuo Yang, Kurt Keutzer, Song Han, Ligeng Zhu - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.14243)</summary>

**Abstract:** Reinforcement learning (RL) is essential for enhancing the complex reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, existing RL training pipelines are computationally inefficient and resource-intensive, with the rollout phase accounting for over 70% of total training time. Quantized RL training, particularly using FP8 precision, offers a promising approach to mitigating this bottleneck. A commonly adopted strategy applies FP8 precision during rollout while retaining BF16 precision for training. In this work, we present the first comprehensive study of FP8 RL training and demonstrate that the widely used BF16-training + FP8-rollout strategy suffers from severe training instability and catastrophic accuracy collapse under long-horizon rollouts and challenging tasks. Our analysis shows that these failures stem from the off-policy nature of the approach, which introduces substantial numerical mismatch between training and inference. Motivated by these observations, we propose Jet-RL, an FP8 RL training framework that enables robust and stable RL optimization. The key idea is to adopt a unified FP8 precision flow for both training and rollout, thereby minimizing numerical discrepancies and eliminating the need for inefficient inter-step calibration. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of Jet-RL: our method achieves up to 33% speedup in the rollout phase, up to 41% speedup in the training phase, and a 16% end-to-end speedup over BF16 training, while maintaining stable convergence across all settings and incurring negligible accuracy degradation.

<summary><strong>Controlling Underestimation Bias in Constrained Reinforcement Learning for Safe Exploration</strong> - Shiqing Gao, Jiaxin Ding, Luoyi Fu, Xinbing Wang - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.11953)</summary>

**Abstract:** Constrained Reinforcement Learning (CRL) aims to maximize cumulative rewards while satisfying constraints. However, existing CRL algorithms often encounter significant constraint violations during training, limiting their applicability in safety-critical scenarios. In this paper, we identify the underestimation of the cost value function as a key factor contributing to these violations. To address this issue, we propose the Memory-driven Intrinsic Cost Estimation (MICE) method, which introduces intrinsic costs to mitigate underestimation and control bias to promote safer exploration. Inspired by flashbulb memory, where humans vividly recall dangerous experiences to avoid risks, MICE constructs a memory module that stores previously explored unsafe states to identify high-cost regions. The intrinsic cost is formulated as the pseudo-count of the current state visiting these risk regions. Furthermore, we propose an extrinsic-intrinsic cost value function that incorporates intrinsic costs and adopts a bias correction strategy. Using this function, we formulate an optimization objective within the trust region, along with corresponding optimization methods. Theoretically, we provide convergence guarantees for the proposed cost value function and establish the worst-case constraint violation for the MICE update. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MICE significantly reduces constraint violations while preserving policy performance comparable to baselines.

<summary><strong>Extreme Value Policy Optimization for Safe Reinforcement Learning</strong> - Shiqing Gao, Yihang Zhou, Shuai Shao, Haoyu Luo, Yiheng Bing, Jiaxin Ding, Luoyi Fu, Xinbing Wang - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.12008)</summary>

**Abstract:** Ensuring safety is a critical challenge in applying Reinforcement Learning (RL) to real-world scenarios. Constrained Reinforcement Learning (CRL) addresses this by maximizing returns under predefined constraints, typically formulated as the expected cumulative cost. However, expectation-based constraints overlook rare but high-impact extreme value events in the tail distribution, such as black swan incidents, which can lead to severe constraint violations. To address this issue, we propose the Extreme Value policy Optimization (EVO) algorithm, leveraging Extreme Value Theory (EVT) to model and exploit extreme reward and cost samples, reducing constraint violations. EVO introduces an extreme quantile optimization objective to explicitly capture extreme samples in the cost tail distribution. Additionally, we propose an extreme prioritization mechanism during replay, amplifying the learning signal from rare but high-impact extreme samples. Theoretically, we establish upper bounds on expected constraint violations during policy updates, guaranteeing strict constraint satisfaction at a zero-violation quantile level. Further, we demonstrate that EVO achieves a lower probability of constraint violations than expectation-based methods and exhibits lower variance than quantile regression methods. Extensive experiments show that EVO significantly reduces constraint violations during training while maintaining competitive policy performance compared to baselines.

<summary><strong>Balancing Classification and Calibration Performance in Decision-Making LLMs via Calibration Aware Reinforcement Learning</strong> - Duygu Nur Yaldiz, Evangelia Spiliopoulou, Zheng Qi, Siddharth Varia, Srikanth Doss, Nikolaos Pappas - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.13284)</summary>

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in decision-making tasks, where not only accuracy but also reliable confidence estimates are essential. Well-calibrated confidence enables downstream systems to decide when to trust a model and when to defer to fallback mechanisms. In this work, we conduct a systematic study of calibration in two widely used fine-tuning paradigms: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). We show that while RLVR improves task performance, it produces extremely overconfident models, whereas SFT yields substantially better calibration, even under distribution shift, though with smaller performance gains. Through targeted experiments, we diagnose RLVR's failure, showing that decision tokens act as extraction steps of the decision in reasoning traces and do not carry confidence information, which prevents reinforcement learning from surfacing calibrated alternatives. Based on this insight, we propose a calibration-aware reinforcement learning formulation that directly adjusts decision-token probabilities. Our method preserves RLVR's accuracy level while mitigating overconfidence, reducing ECE scores up to 9 points.

<summary><strong>Behavior Knowledge Merge in Reinforced Agentic Models</strong> - Xiangchi Yuan, Dachuan Shi, Chunhui Zhang, Zheyuan Liu, Shenglong Yao, Soroush Vosoughi, Wenke Lee - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.13572)</summary>

**Abstract:** Reinforcement learning (RL) is central to post-training, particularly for agentic models that require specialized reasoning behaviors. In this setting, model merging offers a practical mechanism for integrating multiple RL-trained agents from different tasks into a single generalist model. However, existing merging methods are designed for supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and they are suboptimal to preserve task-specific capabilities on RL-trained agentic models. The root is a task-vector mismatch between RL and SFT: on-policy RL induces task vectors that are highly sparse and heterogeneous, whereas SFT-style merging implicitly assumes dense and globally comparable task vectors. When standard global averaging is applied under this mismatch, RL's non-overlapping task vectors that encode critical task-specific behaviors are reduced and parameter updates are diluted. To address this issue, we propose Reinforced Agent Merging (RAM), a distribution-aware merging framework explicitly designed for RL-trained agentic models. RAM disentangles shared and task-specific unique parameter updates, averaging shared components while selectively preserving and rescaling unique ones to counteract parameter update dilution. Experiments across multiple agent domains and model architectures demonstrate that RAM not only surpasses merging baselines, but also unlocks synergistic potential among agents to achieve performance superior to that of specialized agents in their domains.

<summary><strong>RL-BioAug: Label-Efficient Reinforcement Learning for Self-Supervised EEG Representation Learning</strong> - Cheol-Hui Lee, Hwa-Yeon Lee, Dong-Joo Kim - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.13964)</summary>

**Abstract:** The quality of data augmentation serves as a critical determinant for the performance of contrastive learning in EEG tasks. Although this paradigm is promising for utilizing unlabeled data, static or random augmentation strategies often fail to preserve intrinsic information due to the non-stationarity of EEG signals where statistical properties change over time. To address this, we propose RL-BioAug, a framework that leverages a label-efficient reinforcement learning (RL) agent to autonomously determine optimal augmentation policies. While utilizing only a minimal fraction (10%) of labeled data to guide the agent's policy, our method enables the encoder to learn robust representations in a strictly self-supervised manner. Experimental results demonstrate that RL-BioAug significantly outperforms the random selection strategy, achieving substantial improvements of 9.69% and 8.80% in Macro-F1 score on the Sleep-EDFX and CHB-MIT datasets, respectively. Notably, this agent mainly chose optimal strategies for each task--for example, Time Masking with a 62% probability for sleep stage classification and Crop & Resize with a 77% probability for seizure detection. Our framework suggests its potential to replace conventional heuristic-based augmentations and establish a new autonomous paradigm for data augmentation.

<summary><strong>Optimizing Energy and Data Collection in UAV-aided IoT Networks using Attention-based Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning</strong> - Babacar Toure, Dimitrios Tsilimantos, Omid Esrafilian, Marios Kountouris - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.14092)</summary>

**Abstract:** Due to their adaptability and mobility, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are becoming increasingly essential for wireless network services, particularly for data harvesting tasks. In this context, Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based approaches have gained significant attention for addressing UAV path planning tasks in large and complex environments, bridging the gap with real-world deployments. However, many existing algorithms suffer from limited training data, which hampers their performance in highly dynamic environments. Moreover, they often overlook the inherently multi-objective nature of the task, treating it in an overly simplistic manner. To address these limitations, we propose an attention-based Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) architecture that explicitly handles the trade-off between data collection and energy consumption in urban environments, even without prior knowledge of wireless channel conditions. Our method develops a single model capable of adapting to varying trade-off preferences and dynamic scenario parameters without the need for fine-tuning or retraining. Extensive simulations show that our approach achieves substantial improvements in performance, model compactness, sample efficiency, and most importantly, generalization to previously unseen scenarios, outperforming existing RL solutions.

<summary><strong>Attention-Based Offline Reinforcement Learning and Clustering for Interpretable Sepsis Treatment</strong> - Punit Kumar, Vaibhav Saran, Divyesh Patel, Nitin Kulkarni, Alina Vereshchaka - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.14228)</summary>

**Abstract:** Sepsis remains one of the leading causes of mortality in intensive care units, where timely and accurate treatment decisions can significantly impact patient outcomes. In this work, we propose an interpretable decision support framework. Our system integrates four core components: (1) a clustering-based stratification module that categorizes patients into low, intermediate, and high-risk groups upon ICU admission, using clustering with statistical validation; (2) a synthetic data augmentation pipeline leveraging variational autoencoders (VAE) and diffusion models to enrich underrepresented trajectories such as fluid or vasopressor administration; (3) an offline reinforcement learning (RL) agent trained using Advantage Weighted Regression (AWR) with a lightweight attention encoder and supported by an ensemble models for conservative, safety-aware treatment recommendations; and (4) a rationale generation module powered by a multi-modal large language model (LLM), which produces natural-language justifications grounded in clinical context and retrieved expert knowledge. Evaluated on the MIMIC-III and eICU datasets, our approach achieves high treatment accuracy while providing clinicians with interpretable and robust policy recommendations.

**Abstract:** Pixel-based reinforcement learning agents often fail under purely visual distribution shift even when latent dynamics and rewards are unchanged, but existing benchmarks entangle multiple sources of shift and hinder systematic analysis. We introduce KAGE-Env, a JAX-native 2D platformer that factorizes the observation process into independently controllable visual axes while keeping the underlying control problem fixed. By construction, varying a visual axis affects performance only through the induced state-conditional action distribution of a pixel policy, providing a clean abstraction for visual generalization. Building on this environment, we define KAGE-Bench, a benchmark of six known-axis suites comprising 34 train-evaluation configuration pairs that isolate individual visual shifts. Using a standard PPO-CNN baseline, we observe strong axis-dependent failures, with background and photometric shifts often collapsing success, while agent-appearance shifts are comparatively benign. Several shifts preserve forward motion while breaking task completion, showing that return alone can obscure generalization failures. Finally, the fully vectorized JAX implementation enables up to 33M environment steps per second on a single GPU, enabling fast and reproducible sweeps over visual factors. Code: this https URL.

**Abstract:** Wildfires are growing in frequency and intensity, devastating ecosystems and communities while causing billions of dollars in suppression costs and economic damage annually in the U.S. Traditional wildfire management is mostly reactive, addressing fires only after they are detected. We introduce \textit{FireCastRL}, a proactive artificial intelligence (AI) framework that combines wildfire forecasting with intelligent suppression strategies. Our framework first uses a deep spatiotemporal model to predict wildfire ignition. For high-risk predictions, we deploy a pre-trained reinforcement learning (RL) agent to execute real-time suppression tactics with helitack units inside a physics-informed 3D simulation. The framework generates a threat assessment report to help emergency responders optimize resource allocation and planning. In addition, we are publicly releasing a large-scale, spatiotemporal dataset containing $\mathbf{9.5}$ million samples of environmental variables for wildfire prediction. Our work demonstrates how deep learning and RL can be combined to support both forecasting and tactical wildfire response. More details can be found at this https URL.

**Abstract:** Recently, video-based world models that learn to simulate the dynamics have gained increasing attention in robot learning. However, current approaches primarily emphasize visual generative quality while overlooking physical fidelity, dynamic consistency, and task logic, especially for contact-rich manipulation tasks, which limits their applicability to downstream tasks. To this end, we introduce ReWorld, a framework aimed to employ reinforcement learning to align the video-based embodied world models with physical realism, task completion capability, embodiment plausibility and visual quality. Specifically, we first construct a large-scale (~235K) video preference dataset and employ it to train a hierarchical reward model designed to capture multi-dimensional reward consistent with human preferences. We further propose a practical alignment algorithm that post-trains flow-based world models using this reward through a computationally efficient PPO-style algorithm. Comprehensive experiments and theoretical analysis demonstrate that ReWorld significantly improves the physical fidelity, logical coherence, embodiment and visual quality of generated rollouts, outperforming previous methods.

<summary><strong>Autonomous Navigation at the Nano-Scale: Algorithms, Architectures, and Constraints</strong> - Mahmud S. Zango, Jianglin Lan - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.13252)</summary>

**Abstract:** Autonomous navigation for nano-scale unmanned aerial vehicles (nano-UAVs) is governed by extreme Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) constraints (with the weight < 50 g and sub-100 mW onboard processor), distinguishing it fundamentally from standard robotic paradigms. This review synthesizes the state-of-the-art in sensing, computing, and control architectures designed specifically for these sub- 100mW computational envelopes. We critically analyse the transition from classical geometry-based methods to emerging "Edge AI" paradigms, including quantized deep neural networks deployed on ultra-low-power System-on-Chips (SoCs) and neuromorphic event-based control. Beyond algorithms, we evaluate the hardware-software co-design requisite for autonomy, covering advancements in dense optical flow, optimized Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), and learning-based flight control. While significant progress has been observed in visual navigation and relative pose estimation, our analysis reveals persistent gaps in long-term endurance, robust obstacle avoidance in dynamic environments, and the "Sim-to-Real" transfer of reinforcement learning policies. This survey provides a roadmap for bridging these gaps, advocating for hybrid architectures that fuse lightweight classical control with data-driven perception to enable fully autonomous, agile nano-UAVs in GPS-denied environments.

**Abstract:** Backdoor attacks embed hidden malicious behaviors in reinforcement learning (RL) policies and activate them using triggers at test time. Most existing attacks are validated only in simulation, while their effectiveness in real-world robotic systems remains unclear. In physical deployment, safety-constrained control pipelines such as velocity limiting, action smoothing, and collision avoidance suppress abnormal actions, causing strong attenuation of conventional backdoor attacks. We study this previously overlooked problem and propose a diffusion-guided backdoor attack framework (DGBA) for real-world RL. We design small printable visual patch triggers placed on the floor and generate them using a conditional diffusion model that produces diverse patch appearances under real-world visual variations. We treat the robot control stack as a black-box system. We further introduce an advantage-based poisoning strategy that injects triggers only at decision-critical training states. We evaluate our method on a TurtleBot3 mobile robot and demonstrate reliable activation of targeted attacks while preserving normal task performance. Demo videos and code are available in the supplementary material.

**Abstract:** This study presents an emotion-aware navigation framework -- EmoBipedNav -- using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for bipedal robots walking in socially interactive environments. The inherent locomotion constraints of bipedal robots challenge their safe maneuvering capabilities in dynamic environments. When combined with the intricacies of social environments, including pedestrian interactions and social cues, such as emotions, these challenges become even more pronounced. To address these coupled problems, we propose a two-stage pipeline that considers both bipedal locomotion constraints and complex social environments. Specifically, social navigation scenarios are represented using sequential LiDAR grid maps (LGMs), from which we extract latent features, including collision regions, emotion-related discomfort zones, social interactions, and the spatio-temporal dynamics of evolving environments. The extracted features are directly mapped to the actions of reduced-order models (ROMs) through a DRL architecture. Furthermore, the proposed framework incorporates full-order dynamics and locomotion constraints during training, effectively accounting for tracking errors and restrictions of the locomotion controller while planning the trajectory with ROMs. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our approach exceeds both model-based planners and DRL-based baselines.

<summary><strong>DAPPER: Discriminability-Aware Policy-to-Policy Preference-Based Reinforcement Learning for Query-Efficient Robot Skill Acquisition</strong> - Yuki Kadokawa, Jonas Frey, Takahiro Miki, Takamitsu Matsubara, Marco Hutter - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.06357)</summary>

**Abstract:** Preference-based Reinforcement Learning (PbRL) enables policy learning through simple queries comparing trajectories from a single policy. While human responses to these queries make it possible to learn policies aligned with human preferences, PbRL suffers from low query efficiency, as policy bias limits trajectory diversity and reduces the number of discriminable queries available for learning preferences. This paper identifies preference discriminability, which quantifies how easily a human can judge which trajectory is closer to their ideal behavior, as a key metric for improving query efficiency. To address this, we move beyond comparisons within a single policy and instead generate queries by comparing trajectories from multiple policies, as training them from scratch promotes diversity without policy bias. We propose Discriminability-Aware Policy-to-Policy Preference-Based Efficient Reinforcement Learning (DAPPER), which integrates preference discriminability with trajectory diversification achieved by multiple policies. DAPPER trains new policies from scratch after each reward update and employs a discriminator that learns to estimate preference discriminability, enabling the prioritized sampling of more discriminable queries. During training, it jointly maximizes the preference reward and preference discriminability score, encouraging the discovery of highly rewarding and easily distinguishable policies. Experiments in simulated and real-world legged robot environments demonstrate that DAPPER outperforms previous methods in query efficiency, particularly under challenging preference discriminability conditions.

<summary><strong>Exploring General-Purpose Autonomous Multimodal Agents for Pathology Report Generation</strong> - Marc Aubreville, Taryn A. Donovan, Christof A. Bertram - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.11540)</summary>

**Abstract:** Recent advances in agentic artificial intelligence, i.e. systems capable of autonomous perception, reasoning, and tool use, offer new opportunities for digital pathology. In this pilot study, we evaluate whether two agentic multimodal AI systems (OpenAI's ChatGPT 5.0 in agentic mode, and H Company's Surfer) can autonomously navigate, describe, and interpret histopathologic features in digitized tissue slides on a slide viewing platform. A set of 35 veterinary pathology cases, curated for training purposes, was used as the test dataset. The agent was tasked with autonomously exploring whole-slide images using a web-based slide viewer, identifying salient tissue structures, generating descriptive summaries, and proposing provisional diagnoses. We fed different prompts to explore three scenarios: 1) analysis without knowledge of the signalment, 2) analysis with organ and species provided, and 3) diagnosis based on a morphological description provided. All outputs were reviewed and validated by a board-certified pathologist for accuracy and diagnostic consistency. We further tasked another board-certified pathologist with the same task to establish a baseline. We found the systems to yield accurate diagnoses in up to 28.6% of cases with only images, signalment and organ provided, and up to 68.6% when a morphological description was provided. With only the WSI provided, the models were only correct in up to 5.7% of cases. The human expert, on the other hand, achieved 85.7% diagnostic accuracy with only a single WSI, and 88.6% when also signalment and organ was provided.
The study demonstrates that while the agentic AI system can meaningfully engage with web-based slide viewing software to assess complex visual pathology data and produce contextually aligned feature descriptions, diagnostic precision remains limited compared with a human expert.

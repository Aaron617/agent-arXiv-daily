<summary><strong>Supply Chain Exploitation of Secure ROS 2 Systems: A Proof-of-Concept on Autonomous Platform Compromise via Keystore Exfiltration</strong> - Tahmid Hasan Sakib, Yago Romano Martinez, Carter Brady, Syed Rafay Hasan, Terry N. Guo - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.00140)</summary>

**Abstract:** This paper presents a proof-of-concept supply chain attack against the Secure ROS 2 (SROS 2) framework, demonstrated on a Quanser QCar2 autonomous vehicle platform. A Trojan-infected Debian package modifies core ROS 2 security commands to exfiltrate newly generated keystore credentials via DNS in base64-encoded chunks to an attacker-controlled nameserver. Possession of these credentials enables the attacker to rejoin the SROS 2 network as an authenticated participant and publish spoofed control or perception messages without triggering authentication failures. We evaluate this capability on a secure ROS 2 Humble testbed configured for a four-stop-sign navigation routine using an Intel RealSense camera for perception. Experimental results show that control-topic injections can cause forced braking, sustained high-speed acceleration, and continuous turning loops, while perception-topic spoofing can induce phantom stop signs or suppress real detections. The attack generalizes to any data distribution service (DDS)-based robotic system using SROS 2, highlighting the need for both supply chain integrity controls and runtime semantic validation to safeguard autonomous systems against insider and impersonation threats.

<summary><strong>CGM-Led Multimodal Tracking with Chatbot Support: An Autoethnography in Sub-Health</strong> - Dongyijie Primo Pan, Lan Luo, Yike Wang, Pan Hui - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25381)</summary>

**Abstract:** Metabolic disorders present a pressing global health challenge, with China carrying the world's largest burden. While continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) has transformed diabetes care, its potential for supporting sub-health populations -- such as individuals who are overweight, prediabetic, or anxious -- remains underexplored. At the same time, large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in health coaching, yet CGM is rarely incorporated as a first-class signal. To address this gap, we conducted a six-week autoethnography, combining CGM with multimodal indicators captured via common digital devices and a chatbot that offered personalized reflections and explanations of glucose fluctuations. Our findings show how CGM-led, data-first multimodal tracking, coupled with conversational support, shaped everyday practices of diet, activity, stress, and wellbeing. This work contributes to HCI by extending CGM research beyond clinical diabetes and demonstrating how LLM-driven agents can support preventive health and reflection in at-risk populations.

<summary><strong>A CPU-Centric Perspective on Agentic AI</strong> - Ritik Raj, Hong Wang, Tushar Krishna - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.00739)</summary>

**Abstract:** Agentic AI frameworks add a decision-making orchestrator embedded with external tools, including web search, Python interpreter, contextual database, and others, on top of monolithic LLMs, turning them from passive text oracles into autonomous problem-solvers that can plan, call tools, remember past steps, and adapt on the fly.
This paper aims to characterize and understand the system bottlenecks introduced by agentic AI workloads from a largely overlooked CPU-centric perspective. We first systematically characterize Agentic AI on the basis of orchestrator/decision making component, inference path dynamics and repetitiveness of the agentic flow which directly influences the system-level performance. Thereafter, based on the characterization, we choose five representative agentic AI workloads- Haystack RAG, Toolformer, ChemCrow, Langchain and SWE-Agent to profile latency, throughput and energy metrics and demystify the significant impact of CPUs on these metrics relative to GPUs. We observe that - 1. Tool processing on CPUs can take up to 90.6% of the total latency; 2. Agentic throughput gets bottlenecked either by CPU factors - coherence, synchronization and over-subscription of cores or GPU factors - main memory capacity and bandwidth; \circled{3} CPU dynamic energy consumes up to 44% of the total dynamic energy at large batch sizes. Based on the profiling insights, we present two key optimizations- 1. CPU and GPU-Aware Micro-batching (CGAM) and 2. Mixed Agentic Workload Scheduling (MAWS) for homogeneous and heterogeneous agentic workloads respectively to demonstrate the potential to improve the performance, efficiency, and scalability of agentic AI. We achieve up to 2.1x and 1.41x P50 latency speedup compared to the multi-processing benchmark for homogeneous and heterogeneous agentic workloads respectively.

<summary><strong>Hybrid Retrieval-Augmented Generation Agent for Trustworthy Legal Question Answering in Judicial Forensics</strong> - Yueqing Xi, Yifan Bai, Huasen Luo, Weiliang Wen, Hui Liu, Haoliang Li - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.01668)</summary>

**Abstract:** As artificial intelligence permeates judicial forensics, ensuring the veracity and traceability of legal question answering (QA) has become critical. Conventional large language models (LLMs) are prone to hallucination, risking misleading guidance in legal consultation, while static knowledge bases struggle to keep pace with frequently updated statutes and case law. We present a hybrid legal QA agent tailored for judicial settings that integrates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with multi-model ensembling to deliver reliable, auditable, and continuously updatable counsel. The system prioritizes retrieval over generation: when a trusted legal repository yields relevant evidence, answers are produced via RAG; otherwise, multiple LLMs generate candidates that are scored by a specialized selector, with the top-ranked answer returned. High-quality outputs then undergo human review before being written back to the repository, enabling dynamic knowledge evolution and provenance tracking. Experiments on the Law\_QA dataset show that our hybrid approach significantly outperforms both a single-model baseline and a vanilla RAG pipeline on F1, ROUGE-L, and an LLM-as-a-Judge metric. Ablations confirm the complementary contributions of retrieval prioritization, model ensembling, and the human-in-the-loop update mechanism. The proposed system demonstrably reduces hallucination while improving answer quality and legal compliance, advancing the practical landing of media forensics technologies in judicial scenarios.

<summary><strong>End-to-End Dexterous Arm-Hand VLA Policies via Shared Autonomy: VR Teleoperation Augmented by Autonomous Hand VLA Policy for Efficient Data Collection</strong> - Yu Cui, Yujian Zhang, Lina Tao, Yang Li, Xinyu Yi, Zhibin Li - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.00139)</summary>

**Abstract:** Achieving human-like dexterous manipulation remains a major challenge for general-purpose robots. While Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models show potential in learning skills from demonstrations, their scalability is limited by scarce high-quality training data. Existing data collection methods face inherent constraints: manual teleoperation overloads human operators, while automated planning often produces unnatural motions. We propose a Shared Autonomy framework that divides control between macro and micro motions. A human operator guides the robot's arm pose through intuitive VR teleoperation, while an autonomous DexGrasp-VLA policy handles fine-grained hand control using real-time tactile and visual feedback. This division significantly reduces cognitive load and enables efficient collection of high-quality coordinated arm-hand demonstrations. Using this data, we train an end-to-end VLA policy enhanced with our novel Arm-Hand Feature Enhancement module, which captures both distinct and shared representations of macro and micro movements for more natural coordination. Our Corrective Teleoperation system enables continuous policy improvement through human-in-the-loop failure recovery. Experiments demonstrate that our framework generates high-quality data with minimal manpower and achieves a 90% success rate across diverse objects, including unseen instances. Comprehensive evaluations validate the system's effectiveness in developing dexterous manipulation capabilities.

<summary><strong>Understanding Code Agent Behaviour: An Empirical Study of Success and Failure Trajectories</strong> - Oorja Majgaonkar, Zhiwei Fei, Xiang Li, Federica Sarro, He Ye - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.00197)</summary>

**Abstract:** The increasing deployment of Large Language Model (LLM) agents for complex software engineering tasks has created a need to understand their problem-solving behaviours beyond simple success metrics. While these agents demonstrate impressive capabilities in automated issue resolution, their decision-making processes remain largely opaque. This paper presents an empirical study of agent trajectories, namely the execution traces capturing the steps agents take when attempting to resolve software issues. We analyse trajectories from three state-of-the-art code agents (OpenHands, SWE-agent, and Prometheus) on the SWE-Bench benchmark, examining both successful and failed attempts. Our investigation reveals several key insights into agent behaviour. First, we identify how distinct problem-solving strategies, such as defensive programming and context gathering, enable success in different scenarios. Second, we find that failed trajectories are consistently longer and exhibit higher variance than successful ones, with failure patterns differing significantly between agents. Third, our fault localisation analysis shows that while most trajectories correctly identify problematic files (72-81\% even in failures), success depends more on achieving approximate rather than exact code modifications. These and other findings unveiled by our study, provide a foundation for understanding agent behaviour through trajectory analysis, contributing to the development of more robust and interpretable autonomous software engineering systems.

<summary><strong>Continual Learning, Not Training: Online Adaptation For Agents</strong> - Aman Jaglan, Jarrod Barnes - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.01093)</summary>

**Abstract:** Continual Learning (CL) methods have traditionally focused on mitigating catastrophic forgetting through gradient-based retraining, an approach ill-suited for deployed agents that must adapt in real time. We introduce our Adaptive Teaching and Learning System (ATLAS), a dual-agent architecture that decouples reasoning (Teacher) from execution (Student) and incorporates a persistent learning memory that stores distilled guidance from experience. This informs the orchestration layer, enabling the system to dynamically adjust its operational strategies, such as supervision level or initial plan selection, at inference time. In doing so, ATLAS achieves gradient-free continual learning, shifting the locus of adaptation from model parameters to system-level orchestration. We formulate this as a system-centric paradigm for continual learning, where the objective is adaptive efficiency: maximizing task success while minimizing computational cost through inference-time orchestration rather than parameter updates. Evaluated on Microsoft's ExCyTIn-Bench, an open-source benchmark simulating complex cyberthreat investigation, ATLAS achieves 54.1% success with GPT-5-mini as its Student, outperforming the larger GPT-5 (High) by 13% while reducing cost by 86%. Cross-incident validation demonstrates generalization: frozen pamphlets from Incident #5 improve accuracy from 28% to 41% with zero retraining, while shifting output composition from verbose exploration to structured reasoning. Together, these findings establish gradient-free continual learning as a viable path toward adaptive, deployable AI systems and provide causally annotated traces valuable for training explicit world models.

<summary><strong>Sherlock: Reliable and Efficient Agentic Workflow Execution</strong> - Yeonju Ro, Haoran Qiu, Íñigo Goiri, Rodrigo Fonseca, Ricardo Bianchini, Aditya Akella, Zhangyang Wang, Mattan Erez, Esha Choukse - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.00330)</summary>

**Abstract:** With the increasing adoption of large language models (LLM), agentic workflows, which compose multiple LLM calls with tools, retrieval, and reasoning steps, are increasingly replacing traditional applications. However, such workflows are inherently error-prone: incorrect or partially correct output at one step can propagate or even amplify through subsequent stages, compounding the impact on the final output. Recent work proposes integrating verifiers that validate LLM output or actions, such as self-reflection, debate, or LLM-as-a-judge mechanisms. Yet, verifying every step introduces significant latency and cost overheads.
In this work, we seek to answer three key questions: which nodes in a workflow are most error-prone and thus deserve costly verification, how to select the most appropriate verifier for each node, and how to use verification with minimal impact to latency? Our solution, Sherlock, addresses these using counterfactual analysis on agentic workflows to identify error-prone nodes and selectively attaching cost-optimal verifiers only where necessary. At runtime, Sherlock speculatively executes downstream tasks to reduce latency overhead, while verification runs in the background. If verification fails, execution is rolled back to the last verified output. Compared to the non-verifying baseline, Sherlock delivers an 18.3% accuracy gain on average across benchmarks. Sherlock reduces workflow execution time by up to 48.7% over non-speculative execution and lowers verification cost by 26.0% compared to the Monte Carlo search-based method, demonstrating that principled, fault-aware verification effectively balances efficiency and reliability in agentic workflows.

<summary><strong>Deep Video Discovery: Agentic Search with Tool Use for Long-form Video Understanding</strong> - Xiaoyi Zhang, Zhaoyang Jia, Zongyu Guo, Jiahao Li, Bin Li, Houqiang Li, Yan Lu - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.18079)</summary>

**Abstract:** Long-form video understanding presents significant challenges due to extensive temporal-spatial complexity and the difficulty of question answering under such extended contexts. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated considerable advancements in video analysis capabilities and long context handling, they continue to exhibit limitations when processing information-dense hour-long videos. To overcome such limitations, we propose the Deep Video Discovery (DVD) agent to leverage an agentic search strategy over segmented video clips. Unlike previous video agents that rely on predefined workflows applied uniformly across different queries, our approach emphasizes the autonomous and adaptive nature of agents. By providing a set of search-centric tools on multi-granular video database, our DVD agent leverages the advanced reasoning capability of LLM to plan on its current observation state, strategically selects tools to orchestrate adaptive workflow for different queries in light of the gathered information. We perform comprehensive evaluation on multiple long video understanding benchmarks that demonstrates our advantage. Our DVD agent achieves state-of-the-art performance on the challenging LVBench dataset, reaching an accuracy of 74.2%, which substantially surpasses all prior works, and further improves to 76.0% with transcripts. The code has been released at this https URL.

<summary><strong>UI-Evol: Automatic Knowledge Evolving for Computer Use Agents</strong> - Ziyun Zhang, Xinyi Liu, Xiaoyi Zhang, Jun Wang, Gang Chen, Yan Lu - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.21964)</summary>

**Abstract:** External knowledge has played a crucial role in the recent development of computer use agents. We identify a critical knowledge-execution gap: retrieved knowledge often fails to translate into effective real-world task execution. Our analysis shows even 90% correct knowledge yields only 41% execution success rate. To bridge this gap, we propose UI-Evol, a plug-and-play module for autonomous GUI knowledge evolution. UI-Evol consists of two stages: a Retrace Stage that extracts faithful objective action sequences from actual agent-environment interactions, and a Critique Stage that refines existing knowledge by comparing these sequences against external references. We conduct comprehensive experiments on the OSWorld benchmark with the state-of-the-art Agent S2. Our results demonstrate that UI-Evol not only significantly boosts task performance but also addresses a previously overlooked issue of high behavioral standard deviation in computer use agents, leading to superior performance on computer use tasks and substantially improved agent reliability.

<summary><strong>Agentic Auto-Scheduling: An Experimental Study of LLM-Guided Loop Optimization</strong> - Massinissa Merouani, Islem Kara Bernou, Riyadh Baghdadi - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.00592)</summary>

**Abstract:** Automatic code optimization remains a difficult challenge, particularly for complex loop nests on modern hardware. This paper investigates a novel approach to code optimization where Large Language Models (LLMs) guide the process through a closed-loop interaction with a compiler. We present ComPilot, an experimental framework that leverages off-the-shelf LLMs, without any task-specific fine-tuning, as interactive optimization agents. ComPilot establishes a feedback loop where an LLM proposes transformations for a given loop nest to a compiler. The compiler attempts the transformations, reporting back legality status and measured speedup or slowdown. The LLM utilizes this concrete feedback to iteratively refine its optimization strategy. Our extensive evaluation across the PolyBench benchmark suite demonstrates the effectiveness of this zero-shot approach. ComPilot achieves geometric mean speedups of 2.66x (single run) and 3.54x (best-of-5 runs) over the original code. Furthermore, ComPilot demonstrates competitive performance against the state-of-the-art Pluto polyhedral optimizer, outperforming it in many cases. This experimental study demonstrates that general-purpose LLMs can effectively guide the code optimization process when grounded by compiler feedback, opening promising research directions for agentic AI in code optimization.

<summary><strong>Embodied Cognition Augmented End2End Autonomous Driving</strong> - Ling Niu, Xiaoji Zheng, Han Wang, Chen Zheng, Ziyuan Yang, Bokui Chen, Jiangtao Gong - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.01334)</summary>

**Abstract:** In recent years, vision-based end-to-end autonomous driving has emerged as a new paradigm. However, popular end-to-end approaches typically rely on visual feature extraction networks trained under label supervision. This limited supervision framework restricts the generality and applicability of driving models. In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm termed $E^{3}AD$, which advocates for comparative learning between visual feature extraction networks and the general EEG large model, in order to learn latent human driving cognition for enhancing end-to-end planning. In this work, we collected a cognitive dataset for the mentioned contrastive learning process. Subsequently, we investigated the methods and potential mechanisms for enhancing end-to-end planning with human driving cognition, using popular driving models as baselines on publicly available autonomous driving datasets. Both open-loop and closed-loop tests are conducted for a comprehensive evaluation of planning performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the $E^{3}AD$ paradigm significantly enhances the end-to-end planning performance of baseline models. Ablation studies further validate the contribution of driving cognition and the effectiveness of comparative learning process. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to integrate human driving cognition for improving end-to-end autonomous driving planning. It represents an initial attempt to incorporate embodied cognitive data into end-to-end autonomous driving, providing valuable insights for future brain-inspired autonomous driving systems. Our code will be made available at Github

<summary><strong>Portal UX Agent -- A Plug-and-Play Engine for Rendering UIs from Natural Language Specifications</strong> - Xinsong Li, Ning Jiang, Jay Selvaraj - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.00843)</summary>

**Abstract:** The rapid appearance of large language models (LLMs) has led to systems that turn natural-language intent into real user interfaces (UIs). Free-form code generation maximizes expressiveness but often hurts reliability, security, and design-system compliance. In contrast, fully static UIs are easy to govern but lack adaptability. We present the Portal UX Agent, a practical middle way that makes bounded generation work: an LLM plans the UI at a high level, and a deterministic renderer assembles the final interface from a vetted set of components and layout templates. The agent maps intents to a typed composition-template and component specifications-constrained by a schema. This enables auditability, reuse, and safety while preserving flexibility. We also introduce a mixed-methods evaluation framework that combines automatic checks (coverage, property fidelity, layout, accessibility, performance) with an LLM-as-a-Judge rubric to assess semantic alignment and visual polish. Experiments on multi-domain portal scenarios show that the Portal UX Agent reliably turns intent into coherent, usable UIs and performs well on compositionality and clarity. This work advances agentic UI design by combining model-driven representations, plug-and-play rendering, and structured evaluation, paving the way for controllable and trustworthy UI generation.

<summary><strong>LiteCUA: Computer as MCP Server for Computer-Use Agent on AIOS</strong> - Kai Mei, Xi Zhu, Hang Gao, Shuhang Lin, Yongfeng Zhang - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.18829)</summary>

**Abstract:** We present AIOS 1.0, a novel platform designed to advance computer-use agent (CUA) capabilities through environmental contextualization. While existing approaches primarily focus on building more powerful agent frameworks or enhancing agent models, we identify a fundamental limitation: the semantic disconnect between how language models understand the world and how computer interfaces are structured. AIOS 1.0 addresses this challenge by transforming computers into contextual environments that language models can natively comprehend, implementing a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server architecture to abstract computer states and actions. This approach effectively decouples interface complexity from decision complexity, enabling agents to reason more effectively about computing environments. To demonstrate our platform's effectiveness, we introduce LiteCUA, a lightweight computer-use agent built on AIOS 1.0 that achieves a 14.66% success rate on the OSWorld benchmark, outperforming several specialized agent frameworks despite its simple architecture. Our results suggest that contextualizing computer environments for language models represents a promising direction for developing more capable computer-use agents and advancing toward AI that can interact with digital systems.

<summary><strong>Aligning LLM agents with human learning and adjustment behavior: a dual agent approach</strong> - Tianming Liu, Jirong Yang, Yafeng Yin, Manzi Li, Linghao Wang, Zheng Zhu - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.00993)</summary>

**Abstract:** Effective modeling of how human travelers learn and adjust their travel behavior from interacting with transportation systems is critical for system assessment and planning. However, this task is also difficult due to the complex cognition and decision-making involved in such behavior. Recent research has begun to leverage Large Language Model (LLM) agents for this task. Building on this, we introduce a novel dual-agent framework that enables continuous learning and alignment between LLM agents and human travelers on learning and adaptation behavior from online data streams. Our approach involves a set of LLM traveler agents, equipped with a memory system and a learnable persona, which serve as simulators for human travelers. To ensure behavioral alignment, we introduce an LLM calibration agent that leverages the reasoning and analytical capabilities of LLMs to train the personas of these traveler agents. Working together, this dual-agent system is designed to track and align the underlying decision-making mechanisms of travelers and produce realistic, adaptive simulations. Using a real-world dataset from a day-to-day route choice experiment, we show our approach significantly outperforms existing LLM-based methods in both individual behavioral alignment and aggregate simulation accuracy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our method moves beyond simple behavioral mimicry to capture the evolution of underlying learning processes, a deeper alignment that fosters robust generalization. Overall, our framework provides a new approach for creating adaptive and behaviorally realistic agents to simulate travelers' learning and adaptation that can benefit transportation simulation and policy analysis.

<summary><strong>TPS-Bench: Evaluating AI Agents' Tool Planning \& Scheduling Abilities in Compounding Tasks</strong> - Hanwen Xu, Xuyao Huang, Yuzhe Liu, Kai Yu, Zhijie Deng - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.01527)</summary>

**Abstract:** Large language model (LLM) agents have exhibited strong problem-solving competence across domains like research and coding. Yet, it remains underexplored whether LLM agents can tackle compounding real-world problems that require a diverse set of tools to complete. Given a broad, heterogeneous tool repository, LLM agents must not only select appropriate tools based on task planning analysis but also strategically schedule the execution order to ensure efficiency. This paper introduces TPS-Bench to benchmark the ability of LLM agents in solving such problems that demand Tool Planning and Scheduling. TPS-Bench collects 200 compounding tasks of two difficulty levels, based on a tool repository containing hundreds of model context protocol (MCP) tools. In particular, each task is composed of multiple subtasks, such as web search, map navigation, calendar checking, etc., and each subtask can be completed by a basic tool. Our evaluation emphasizes both task completion rate and efficiency. The empirical studies on popular closed-source and open-source LLMs indicate that most models can perform reasonable tool planning, but differ in scheduling. For example, GLM-4.5 achieves an outperforming task completion rate of 64.72% with extensive sequential tool calls, hence suffering from significantly long execution time. By contrast, GPT-4o prioritizes parallel tool calls but achieves only a 45.08% completion rate. Considering reinforcement learning (RL) can be a viable way to improve the scheduling efficiency without compromising performance, we perform an initial study on Qwen3-1.7B and witness a 14% reduction in execution time alongside a 6% gain in task completion rate based on rarely 100 RL training samples.

<summary><strong>Simulating Environments with Reasoning Models for Agent Training</strong> - Yuetai Li, Huseyin A Inan, Xiang Yue, Wei-Ning Chen, Lukas Wutschitz, Janardhan Kulkarni, Radha Poovendran, Robert Sim, Saravan Rajmohan - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.01824)</summary>

**Abstract:** LLM agents excel in compact environments requiring deep reasoning but remain brittle when operating in broader, more complex contexts that demand robustness across diverse tools and schemas. Building bespoke environments for training is heavy, brittle, and limits progress. In this paper, we demonstrate that LLMs can simulate realistic environment feedback without access to actual testbed data or APIs. Inspired by this capability, we propose two frameworks: Simia-SFT, a pipeline that synthesizes SFT data by amplifying small seed sets into diverse trajectories in an environment-agnostic manner, and Simia-RL, a framework that enables RL training without real environment implementations through LLM-simulated feedback. Fine-tuning open models yields consistent improvements across multiple benchmarks, surpassing GPT-4o and approaching o4-mini on $\tau^2$-Bench. Together, Simia-SFT and Simia-RL enable scalable agent training without environment engineering, replacing heavy and brittle implementations with flexible LLM-based simulation.

<summary><strong>GrowthHacker: Automated Off-Policy Evaluation Optimization Using Code-Modifying LLM Agents</strong> - Jie JW Wu, Ayanda Patrick Herlihy, Ahmad Saleem Mirza, Ali Afoud, Fatemeh Fard - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.00802)</summary>

**Abstract:** With the software industry shifting toward a data-driven culture, online A/B testing is a key tool for evaluating new technologies. However, deploying such experiments requires substantial resources, may negatively impact users, and involves long data collection periods. To address this, \textit{off-policy evaluation (OPE)}, or offline A/B testing, uses logged data to assess technologies and is fundamental in Reinforcement Learning, making it crucial in domains where online testing is costly or risky, such as healthcare, recommender systems, education, dialog systems, and robotics. Despite advances in coding LLMs and agentic AI, little is known about leveraging them to optimize OPE results. We investigate whether LLMs and LLM-based agents can improve OPE performance via code optimization. We propose \textit{GrowthHacker}, a benchmark with agent and baseline methods on large-scale real-world datasets, which iteratively optimizes code, evaluates results, and begins new optimization cycles. We collected datasets, established protocols, implemented baselines for OPE on the Open Bandit Pipeline (OBP)~\cite{saito2021openbanditdatasetpipeline} and Scope-RL~\cite{kiyohara2023scope}, and developed the \textit{two_agent} framework, which reduces system complexity while preserving optimization effectiveness. Results show the two_agent framework achieves 100% reliability and the highest average improvement of 106.7% among positive outcomes. Both two_agent and CrewAI reach 45% success rates, outperforming AutoGen's 34%. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of LLM-based agents as automated "growth hackers" to enhance OPE systems, with implications for scaling data-driven decision-making in production.

<summary><strong>Where to Search: Measure the Prior-Structured Search Space of LLM Agents</strong> - Zhuo-Yang Song - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.14846)</summary>

**Abstract:** The generate-filter-refine (iterative paradigm) based on large language models (LLMs) has achieved progress in reasoning, programming, and program discovery in AI+Science. However, the effectiveness of search depends on where to search, namely, how to encode the domain prior into an operationally structured hypothesis space. To this end, this paper proposes a compact formal theory that describes and measures LLM-assisted iterative search guided by domain priors. We represent an agent as a fuzzy relation operator on inputs and outputs to capture feasible transitions; the agent is thereby constrained by a fixed safety envelope. To describe multi-step reasoning/search, we weight all reachable paths by a single continuation parameter and sum them to obtain a coverage generating function; this induces a measure of reachability difficulty; and it provides a geometric interpretation of search on the graph induced by the safety envelope. We further provide the simplest testable inferences and validate them via two instantiation. This theory offers a workable language and operational tools to measure agents and their search spaces, proposing a systematic formal description of iterative search constructed by LLMs.

<summary><strong>Single-agent Reinforcement Learning Model for Regional Adaptive Traffic Signal Control</strong> - Qiang Li, Ningjing Zeng, Lina Yu - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.00551)</summary>

**Abstract:** Several studies have employed reinforcement learning (RL) to address the challenges of regional adaptive traffic signal control (ATSC) and achieved promising results. In this field, existing research predominantly adopts multi-agent frameworks. However, the adoption of multi-agent frameworks presents challenges for scalability. Instead, the Traffic signal control (TSC) problem necessitates a single-agent framework. TSC inherently relies on centralized management by a single control center, which can monitor traffic conditions across all roads in the study area and coordinate the control of all intersections. This work proposes a single-agent RL-based regional ATSC model compatible with probe vehicle technology. Key components of the RL design include state, action, and reward function definitions. To facilitate learning and manage congestion, both state and reward functions are defined based on queue length, with action designed to regulate queue dynamics. The queue length definition used in this study differs slightly from conventional definitions but is closely correlated with congestion states. More importantly, it allows for reliable estimation using link travel time data from probe vehicles. With probe vehicle data already covering most urban roads, this feature enhances the proposed method's potential for widespread deployment. The method was comprehensively evaluated using the SUMO simulation platform. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model effectively mitigates large-scale regional congestion levels via coordinated multi-intersection control.

<summary><strong>Leveraging Multi-Agent System (MAS) and Fine-Tuned Small Language Models (SLMs) for Automated Telecom Network Troubleshooting</strong> - Chenhua Shi, Bhavika Jalli, Gregor Macdonald, John Zou, Wanlu Lei, Mridul Jain, Joji Philip - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.00651)</summary>

**Abstract:** Telecom networks are rapidly growing in scale and complexity, making effective management, operation, and optimization increasingly challenging. Although Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been applied to many telecom tasks, existing models are often narrow in scope, require large amounts of labeled data, and struggle to generalize across heterogeneous deployments. Consequently, network troubleshooting continues to rely heavily on Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) to manually correlate various data sources to identify root causes and corrective actions. To address these limitations, we propose a Multi-Agent System (MAS) that employs an agentic workflow, with Large Language Models (LLMs) coordinating multiple specialized tools for fully automated network troubleshooting. Once faults are detected by AI/ML-based monitors, the framework dynamically activates agents such as an orchestrator, solution planner, executor, data retriever, and root-cause analyzer to diagnose issues and recommend remediation strategies within a short time frame. A key component of this system is the solution planner, which generates appropriate remediation plans based on internal documentation. To enable this, we fine-tuned a Small Language Model (SLM) on proprietary troubleshooting documents to produce domain-grounded solution plans. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly accelerates troubleshooting automation across both Radio Access Network (RAN) and Core network domains.

<summary><strong>Reevaluating Self-Consistency Scaling in Multi-Agent Systems</strong> - Chiyan Loo - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.00751)</summary>

**Abstract:** This study examines the trade-offs of increasing sampled reasoning paths in self-consistency for modern large language models (LLMs). Earlier research with older models showed that combining multiple reasoning chains improves results before reaching a plateau. Using Gemini 2.5 models on HotpotQA and Math-500, we revisit those claims under current model conditions. Each configuration pooled outputs from varying sampled reasoning paths and compared them to a single chain-of-thought (CoT) baseline. Larger models exhibited a more stable and consistent improvement curve. The results confirm that performance gains taper off after moderate sampling, aligning with past findings. This plateau suggests diminishing returns driven by overlap among reasoning paths. Self-consistency remains useful, but high-sample configurations offer little benefit relative to their computational cost.

<summary><strong>Modular Task Decomposition and Dynamic Collaboration in Multi-Agent Systems Driven by Large Language Models</strong> - Shuaidong Pan, Di Wu - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.01149)</summary>

**Abstract:** This paper addresses the limitations of a single agent in task decomposition and collaboration during complex task execution, and proposes a multi-agent architecture for modular task decomposition and dynamic collaboration based on large language models. The method first converts natural language task descriptions into unified semantic representations through a large language model. On this basis, a modular decomposition mechanism is introduced to break down the overall goal into multiple hierarchical sub-tasks. Then, dynamic scheduling and routing mechanisms enable reasonable division of labor and realtime collaboration among agents, allowing the system to adjust strategies continuously according to environmental feedback, thus maintaining efficiency and stability in complex tasks. Furthermore, a constraint parsing and global consistency mechanism is designed to ensure coherent connections between sub-tasks and balanced workload, preventing performance degradation caused by redundant communication or uneven resource allocation. The experiments validate the architecture across multiple dimensions, including task success rate, decomposition efficiency, sub-task coverage, and collaboration balance. The results show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches in both overall performance and robustness, achieving a better balance between task complexity and communication overhead. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the effectiveness and feasibility of language-driven task decomposition and dynamic collaboration in multi-agent systems, providing a systematic solution for task execution in complex environments.

<summary><strong>From Passive to Proactive: A Multi-Agent System with Dynamic Task Orchestration for Intelligent Medical Pre-Consultation</strong> - ChengZhang Yu, YingRu He, Hongyan Cheng, nuo Cheng, Zhixing Liu, Dongxu Mu, Zhangrui Shen, Zhanpeng Jin - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.01445)</summary>

**Abstract:** Global healthcare systems face critical challenges from increasing patient volumes and limited consultation times, with primary care visits averaging under 5 minutes in many countries. While pre-consultation processes encompassing triage and structured history-taking offer potential solutions, they remain limited by passive interaction paradigms and context management challenges in existing AI systems. This study introduces a hierarchical multi-agent framework that transforms passive medical AI systems into proactive inquiry agents through autonomous task orchestration. We developed an eight-agent architecture with centralized control mechanisms that decomposes pre-consultation into four primary tasks: Triage ($T_1$), History of Present Illness collection ($T_2$), Past History collection ($T_3$), and Chief Complaint generation ($T_4$), with $T_1$--$T_3$ further divided into 13 domain-specific subtasks. Evaluated on 1,372 validated electronic health records from a Chinese medical platform across multiple foundation models (GPT-OSS 20B, Qwen3-8B, Phi4-14B), the framework achieved 87.0% accuracy for primary department triage and 80.5% for secondary department classification, with task completion rates reaching 98.2% using agent-driven scheduling versus 93.1% with sequential processing. Clinical quality scores from 18 physicians averaged 4.56 for Chief Complaints, 4.48 for History of Present Illness, and 4.69 for Past History on a 5-point scale, with consultations completed within 12.7 rounds for $T_2$ and 16.9 rounds for $T_3$. The model-agnostic architecture maintained high performance across different foundation models while preserving data privacy through local deployment, demonstrating the potential for autonomous AI systems to enhance pre-consultation efficiency and quality in clinical settings.

<summary><strong>Urban-MAS: Human-Centered Urban Prediction with LLM-Based Multi-Agent System</strong> - Shangyu Lou - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.00096)</summary>

**Abstract:** Urban Artificial Intelligence (Urban AI) has advanced human-centered urban tasks such as perception prediction and human dynamics. Large Language Models (LLMs) can integrate multimodal inputs to address heterogeneous data in complex urban systems but often underperform on domain-specific tasks. Urban-MAS, an LLM-based Multi-Agent System (MAS) framework, is introduced for human- centered urban prediction under zero-shot settings. It includes three agent types: Predictive Factor Guidance Agents, which prioritize key predictive factors to guide knowledge extraction and enhance the effectiveness of compressed urban knowledge in LLMs; Reliable UrbanInfo Extraction Agents, which improve robustness by com- paring multiple outputs, validating consistency, and re-extracting when conflicts occur; and Multi-UrbanInfo Inference Agents, which integrate extracted multi-source information across dimensions for prediction. Experiments on running-amount prediction and ur- ban perception across Tokyo, Milan, and Seattle demonstrate that Urban-MAS substantially reduces errors compared to single-LLM baselines. Ablation studies indicate that Predictive Factor Guidance Agents are most critical for enhancing predictive performance, po- sitioning Urban-MAS as a scalable paradigm for human-centered urban AI prediction.

**Abstract:** Liquid cooling is critical for thermal management in high-density data centers with the rising AI workloads. However, machine learning-based controllers are essential to unlock greater energy efficiency and reliability, promoting sustainability. We present LC-Opt, a Sustainable Liquid Cooling (LC) benchmark environment, for reinforcement learning (RL) control strategies in energy-efficient liquid cooling of high-performance computing (HPC) systems. Built on the baseline of a high-fidelity digital twin of Oak Ridge National Lab's Frontier Supercomputer cooling system, LC-Opt provides detailed Modelica-based end-to-end models spanning site-level cooling towers to data center cabinets and server blade groups. RL agents optimize critical thermal controls like liquid supply temperature, flow rate, and granular valve actuation at the IT cabinet level, as well as cooling tower (CT) setpoints through a Gymnasium interface, with dynamic changes in workloads. This environment creates a multi-objective real-time optimization challenge balancing local thermal regulation and global energy efficiency, and also supports additional components like a heat recovery unit (HRU). We benchmark centralized and decentralized multi-agent RL approaches, demonstrate policy distillation into decision and regression trees for interpretable control, and explore LLM-based methods that explain control actions in natural language through an agentic mesh architecture designed to foster user trust and simplify system management. LC-Opt democratizes access to detailed, customizable liquid cooling models, enabling the ML community, operators, and vendors to develop sustainable data center liquid cooling control solutions.

<summary><strong>Who Can We Trust? Scope-Aware Video Moment Retrieval with Multi-Agent Conflict</strong> - Chaochen Wu, Guan Luo, Meiyun Zuo, Zhitao Fan - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.00370)</summary>

**Abstract:** Video moment retrieval uses a text query to locate a moment from a given untrimmed video reference. Locating corresponding video moments with text queries helps people interact with videos efficiently. Current solutions for this task have not considered conflict within location results from different models, so various models cannot integrate correctly to produce better results. This study introduces a reinforcement learning-based video moment retrieval model that can scan the whole video once to find the moment's boundary while producing its locational evidence. Moreover, we proposed a multi-agent system framework that can use evidential learning to resolve conflicts between agents' localization output. As a side product of observing and dealing with conflicts between agents, we can decide whether a query has no corresponding moment in a video (out-of-scope) without additional training, which is suitable for real-world applications. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of our proposed methods compared with state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, the results of our study reveal that modeling competition and conflict of the multi-agent system is an effective way to improve RL performance in moment retrieval and show the new role of evidential learning in the multi-agent framework.

<summary><strong>Robust Single-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Regional Traffic Signal Control Under Demand Fluctuations</strong> - Qiang Li, Jin Niu, Lina Yu - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.00549)</summary>

**Abstract:** Traffic congestion, primarily driven by intersection queuing, significantly impacts urban living standards, safety, environmental quality, and economic efficiency. While Traffic Signal Control (TSC) systems hold potential for congestion mitigation, traditional optimization models often fail to capture real-world traffic complexity and dynamics. This study introduces a novel single-agent reinforcement learning (RL) framework for regional adaptive TSC, circumventing the coordination complexities inherent in multi-agent systems through a centralized decision-making paradigm. The model employs an adjacency matrix to unify the encoding of road network topology, real-time queue states derived from probe vehicle data, and current signal timing parameters. Leveraging the efficient learning capabilities of the DreamerV3 world model, the agent learns control policies where actions sequentially select intersections and adjust their signal phase splits to regulate traffic inflow/outflow, analogous to a feedback control system. Reward design prioritizes queue dissipation, directly linking congestion metrics (queue length) to control actions. Simulation experiments conducted in SUMO demonstrate the model's effectiveness: under inference scenarios with multi-level (10%, 20%, 30%) Origin-Destination (OD) demand fluctuations, the framework exhibits robust anti-fluctuation capability and significantly reduces queue lengths. This work establishes a new paradigm for intelligent traffic control compatible with probe vehicle technology. Future research will focus on enhancing practical applicability by incorporating stochastic OD demand fluctuations during training and exploring regional optimization mechanisms for contingency events.

**Abstract:** With the rapid progress of large language models (LLMs), LLM-powered multi-agent systems (MAS) are drawing increasing interest across academia and industry. However, many current MAS frameworks struggle with reliability and scalability, especially on complex tasks. We present AgentGit, a framework that brings Git-like rollback and branching to MAS workflows. Built as an infrastructure layer on top of LangGraph, AgentGit supports state commit, revert, and branching, allowing agents to traverse, compare, and explore multiple trajectories efficiently. To evaluate AgentGit, we designed an experiment that optimizes target agents by selecting better prompts. We ran a multi-step A/B test against three baselines -- LangGraph, AutoGen, and Agno -- on a real-world task: retrieving and analyzing paper abstracts. Results show that AgentGit significantly reduces redundant computation, lowers runtime and token usage, and supports parallel exploration across multiple branches, enhancing both reliability and scalability in MAS development. This work offers a practical path to more robust MAS design and enables error recovery, safe exploration, iterative debugging, and A/B testing in collaborative AI systems.

<summary><strong>On the Fundamental Limitations of Decentralized Learnable Reward Shaping in Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</strong> - Aditya Akella - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.00034)</summary>

**Abstract:** Recent advances in learnable reward shaping have shown promise in single-agent reinforcement learning by automatically discovering effective feedback signals. However, the effectiveness of decentralized learnable reward shaping in cooperative multi-agent settings remains poorly understood. We propose DMARL-RSA, a fully decentralized system where each agent learns individual reward shaping, and evaluate it on cooperative navigation tasks in the simple_spread_v3 environment. Despite sophisticated reward learning, DMARL-RSA achieves only -24.20 +/- 0.09 average reward, compared to MAPPO with centralized training at 1.92 +/- 0.87--a 26.12-point gap. DMARL-RSA performs similarly to simple independent learning (IPPO: -23.19 +/- 0.96), indicating that advanced reward shaping cannot overcome fundamental decentralized coordination limitations. Interestingly, decentralized methods achieve higher landmark coverage (0.888 +/- 0.029 for DMARL-RSA, 0.960 +/- 0.045 for IPPO out of 3 total) but worse overall performance than centralized MAPPO (0.273 +/- 0.008 landmark coverage)--revealing a coordination paradox between local optimization and global performance. Analysis identifies three critical barriers: (1) non-stationarity from concurrent policy updates, (2) exponential credit assignment complexity, and (3) misalignment between individual reward optimization and global objectives. These results establish empirical limits for decentralized reward learning and underscore the necessity of centralized coordination for effective multi-agent cooperation.

<summary><strong>Predictive Auxiliary Learning for Belief-based Multi-Agent Systems</strong> - Qinwei Huang, Stefan Wang, Simon Khan, Garrett Katz, Qinru Qiu - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.01078)</summary>

**Abstract:** The performance of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) in partially observable environments depends on effectively aggregating information from observations, communications, and reward signals. While most existing multi-agent systems primarily rely on rewards as the only feedback for policy training, our research shows that introducing auxiliary predictive tasks can significantly enhance learning efficiency and stability. We propose Belief-based Predictive Auxiliary Learning (BEPAL), a framework that incorporates auxiliary training objectives to support policy optimization. BEPAL follows the centralized training with decentralized execution paradigm. Each agent learns a belief model that predicts unobservable state information, such as other agents' rewards or motion directions, alongside its policy model. By enriching hidden state representations with information that does not directly contribute to immediate reward maximization, this auxiliary learning process stabilizes MARL training and improves overall performance. We evaluate BEPAL in the predator-prey environment and Google Research Football, where it achieves an average improvement of about 16 percent in performance metrics and demonstrates more stable convergence compared to baseline methods.

<summary><strong>From Pixels to Cooperation Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning based on Multimodal World Models</strong> - Sureyya Akin, Kavita Srivastava, Prateek B. Kapoor, Pradeep G. Sethi, Sunita Q. Patel, Rahu Srivastava - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.01310)</summary>

**Abstract:** Learning cooperative multi-agent policies directly from high-dimensional, multimodal sensory inputs like pixels and audio (from pixels) is notoriously sample-inefficient. Model-free Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithms struggle with the joint challenge of representation learning, partial observability, and credit assignment. To address this, we propose a novel framework based on a shared, generative Multimodal World Model (MWM). Our MWM is trained to learn a compressed latent representation of the environment's dynamics by fusing distributed, multimodal observations from all agents using a scalable attention-based mechanism. Subsequently, we leverage this learned MWM as a fast, "imagined" simulator to train cooperative MARL policies (e.g., MAPPO) entirely within its latent space, decoupling representation learning from policy learning. We introduce a new set of challenging multimodal, multi-agent benchmarks built on a 3D physics simulator. Our experiments demonstrate that our MWM-MARL framework achieves orders-of-magnitude greater sample efficiency compared to state-of-the-art model-free MARL baselines. We further show that our proposed multimodal fusion is essential for task success in environments with sensory asymmetry and that our architecture provides superior robustness to sensor-dropout, a critical feature for real-world deployment.

<summary><strong>MARFT: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Fine-Tuning</strong> - Junwei Liao, Muning Wen, Jun Wang, Weinan Zhang - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.16129)</summary>

**Abstract:** LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in addressing complex, agentic tasks, from generating high-quality presentation slides to even conducting sophisticated scientific research. Meanwhile, RL has been widely recognized for its effectiveness in enhancing agent intelligence, but limited research has investigated the fine-tuning of LaMAS using foundational RL techniques. Moreover, the direct application of MARL methods to LaMAS introduces significant challenges, stemming from the unique characteristics and mechanisms inherent to LaMAS. To address these challenges, this article presents a comprehensive study of LLM-based MARL and proposes a novel paradigm termed Multi-Agent Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (MARFT). We introduce a brand-new MG called Flex-MG, which aligns with the LaMAS optimization in real-world applications and a universal algorithmic framework tailored specifically for LaMAS, outlining the conceptual foundations, key distinctions, and practical implementation strategies. We review the evolution from RL to RFT, setting the stage for a parallel analysis in the multi-agent domain. In the context of LaMAS, we elucidate critical differences between MARL and MARFT. These differences motivate a transition toward a LaMAS-oriented formulation of RFT. Central to this work is a robust and scalable MARFT framework. We detail the core algorithm and provide a complete, open-source implementation to facilitate adoption and further research. The latter sections of the paper explore real-world application perspectives and opening challenges in MARFT. By bridging theoretical underpinnings with practical methodologies, this work serves as a roadmap for researchers seeking to advance MARFT toward resilient and adaptive solutions in agentic systems. Our implementation of the proposed framework is publicly available at: this https URL.

<summary><strong>KVCOMM: Online Cross-context KV-cache Communication for Efficient LLM-based Multi-agent Systems</strong> - Hancheng Ye, Zhengqi Gao, Mingyuan Ma, Qinsi Wang, Yuzhe Fu, Ming-Yu Chung, Yueqian Lin, Zhijian Liu, Jianyi Zhang, Danyang Zhuo, Yiran Chen - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12872)</summary>

**Abstract:** Multi-agent large language model (LLM) systems are increasingly adopted for complex language processing tasks that require communication and coordination among agents. However, these systems often suffer substantial overhead from repeated reprocessing of overlapping contexts across agents. In typical pipelines, once an agent receives a message from its predecessor, the full context-including prior turns-must be reprocessed from scratch, leading to inefficient processing. While key-value (KV) caching is an effective solution for avoiding redundant computation in single-agent settings where prefixes remain unchanged, it cannot be directly reused in multi-agent scenarios due to diverging prefixes introduced by agent-specific context extensions. We identify that the core challenge lies in the offset variance of KV-caches across agents. To address this, we propose KVCOMM, a training-free framework that enables efficient prefilling in multi-agent inference by reusing KV-caches and aligning cache offsets of overlapping contexts under diverse prefix contexts. KVCOMM estimates and adjusts KV-caches for shared content by referencing a pool of cached examples-termed anchors-that store observed cache deviations under varying prefixes. The anchor pool is maintained and updated online, allowing dynamic adaptation to distinct user requests and context structures. KVCOMM achieves over 70% reuse rate across diverse multi-agent workloads, including retrieval-augmented generation, math reasoning, and collaborative coding tasks, all without quality degradation. Particularly, when each fully-connected agent receives 1K input tokens with 512 prefix tokens and 512 output tokens under a five-agent setting, KVCOMM achieves up to 7.8x speedup compared to the standard prefill pipeline, reducing TTFT from ~430 ms to ~55 ms.

**Abstract:** Graphs are widely used for modeling relational data in real-world scenarios, such as social networks and urban computing. Existing LLM-based graph analysis approaches either integrate graph neural networks (GNNs) for specific machine learning tasks, limiting their transferability, or rely solely on LLMs' internal reasoning ability, resulting in suboptimal performance. To address these limitations, we take advantage of recent advances in LLM-based agents, which have shown capabilities of utilizing external knowledge or tools for problem solving. By simulating human problem-solving strategies such as analogy and collaboration, we propose a multi-agent system based on LLMs named GraphTeam, for graph analysis. GraphTeam consists of five LLM-based agents from three modules, and the agents with different specialities can collaborate with each other to address complex problems. Specifically, (1) input-output normalization module: the question agent extracts and refines four key arguments from the original question, facilitating the problem understanding, and the answer agent organizes the results to meet the output requirement; (2) external knowledge retrieval module: we first build a knowledge base consisting of relevant documentation and experience information, and then the search agent retrieves the most relevant entries for each question. (3) problem-solving module: given the retrieved information from search agent, the coding agent uses established algorithms via programming to generate solutions, and in case the coding agent does not work, the reasoning agent will directly compute the results without programming. Extensive experiments on six graph analysis benchmarks demonstrate that GraphTeam achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average 25.85% improvement over the best baseline in terms of accuracy.

**Abstract:** Though Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are being actively explored in medicine, their ability to conduct complex real-world telemedicine consultations combining accurate diagnosis with professional dialogue remains underexplored. This paper presents 3MDBench (Medical Multimodal Multi-agent Dialogue Benchmark), an open-source framework for simulating and evaluating LVLM-driven telemedical consultations. 3MDBench simulates patient variability through temperament-based Patient Agent and evaluates diagnostic accuracy and dialogue quality via Assessor Agent. It includes 2996 cases across 34 diagnoses from real-world telemedicine interactions, combining textual and image-based data. The experimental study compares diagnostic strategies for widely used open and closed-source LVLMs. We demonstrate that multimodal dialogue with internal reasoning improves F1 score by 6.5% over non-dialogue settings, highlighting the importance of context-aware, information-seeking questioning. Moreover, injecting predictions from a diagnostic convolutional neural network into the LVLM's context boosts F1 by up to 20%. Source code is available at this https URL.

**Abstract:** Reinforcement learning (RL) systems have countless applications, from energy-grid management to protein design. However, such real-world scenarios are often extremely difficult, combinatorial in nature, and require complex coordination between multiple agents. This level of complexity can cause even state-of-the-art RL systems, trained until convergence, to hit a performance ceiling which they are unable to break out of with zero-shot inference. Meanwhile, many digital or simulation-based applications allow for an inference phase that utilises a specific time and compute budget to explore multiple attempts before outputting a final solution. In this work, we show that such an inference phase employed at execution time, and the choice of a corresponding inference strategy, are key to breaking the performance ceiling observed in complex multi-agent RL problems. Our main result is striking: we can obtain up to a 126% and, on average, a 45% improvement over the previous state-of-the-art across 17 tasks, using only a couple seconds of extra wall-clock time during execution. We also demonstrate promising compute scaling properties, supported by over 60k experiments, making it the largest study on inference strategies for complex RL to date.

<summary><strong>Language-Driven Coordination and Learning in Multi-Agent Simulation Environments</strong> - Zhengyang Li, Sawyer Campos, Nana Wang - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04251)</summary>

**Abstract:** This paper introduces LLM-MARL, a unified framework that incorporates large language models (LLMs) into multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to enhance coordination, communication, and generalization in simulated game environments. The framework features three modular components of Coordinator, Communicator, and Memory, which dynamically generate subgoals, facilitate symbolic inter-agent messaging, and support episodic recall. Training combines PPO with a language-conditioned loss and LLM query gating. LLM-MARL is evaluated in Google Research Football, MAgent Battle, and StarCraft II. Results show consistent improvements over MAPPO and QMIX in win rate, coordination score, and zero-shot generalization. Ablation studies demonstrate that subgoal generation and language-based messaging each contribute significantly to performance gains. Qualitative analysis reveals emergent behaviors such as role specialization and communication-driven tactics. By bridging language modeling and policy learning, this work contributes to the design of intelligent, cooperative agents in interactive simulations. It offers a path forward for leveraging LLMs in multi-agent systems used for training, games, and human-AI collaboration.

**Abstract:** The openness of social media enables the free exchange of opinions, but it also presents challenges in guiding opinion evolution towards global consensus. Existing methods often directly modify user views or enforce cross-group connections. These intrusive interventions undermine user autonomy, provoke psychological resistance, and reduce the efficiency of global consensus. Additionally, due to the lack of a long-term perspective, promoting local consensus often exacerbates divisions at the macro level. To address these issues, we propose the hierarchical, non-intrusive opinion guidance framework, H-NeiFi. It first establishes a two-layer dynamic model based on social roles, considering the behavioral characteristics of both experts and non-experts. Additionally, we introduce a non-intrusive neighbor filtering method that adaptively controls user communication channels. Using multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), we optimize information propagation paths through a long-term reward function, avoiding direct interference with user interactions. Experiments show that H-NeiFi increases consensus speed by 22.0% to 30.7% and maintains global convergence even in the absence of experts. This approach enables natural and efficient consensus guidance by protecting user interaction autonomy, offering a new paradigm for social network governance.

**Abstract:** Translating natural language to SQL remains difficult for complex queries. Such queries often need environmental interaction and self-correction. To address this, we introduce MARS-SQL, a novel multi-agent framework that combines principled task decomposition and interactive reinforcement learning (RL). Our system comprises three specialized agents: a Grounding Agent for schema linking, a Generation Agent for query generation, and a Validation Agent for final selection. The core of our framework is the Generation agent, which is trained via a multi-turn RL policy. Adopting a ReAct-style Think-Act-Observe loop, the agent iteratively generates thoughts, executes SQL actions against a live database, and revises its strategy based on execution feedback, enabling dynamic, stateful reasoning and self-correction. At inference time, we generate multiple interaction trajectories to explore diverse reasoning paths. The Validation agent, then selects the optimal trajectory by modeling verification as a next-token prediction task and choosing the solution with the highest generation probability. This structured workflow pipelines specialized agents. It combines interactive RL for generation with generative modeling for verification. The approach proves highly effective for robust and accurate SQL generation. Experiments show that MARS-SQL achieves state-of-the-art Execution Accuracy of 77.84% on the BIRD dev set and 89.75% on the Spider test set. Our code is available at this https URL.

**Abstract:** Recent advances in LLM Multi-Agent Systems enable scalable orchestration of sub-agents, each coordinating hundreds or thousands of tools or Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. However, existing retrieval methods typically match queries against coarse agent-level descriptions before routing, which obscures fine-grained tool functionality and often results in suboptimal agent selection. We introduce Tool-to-Agent Retrieval, a unified framework that embeds both tools and their parent agents in a shared vector space and connects them through metadata relationships. By explicitly representing tool capabilities and traversing metadata to the agent level, Tool-to-Agent Retrieval enables granular tool-level or agent-level retrieval, ensuring that agents and their underlying tools or MCP servers are equally represented without the context dilution that arises from chunking many tools together. Evaluating Tool-to-Agent Retrieval across eight embedding models, our approach achieves consistent improvements of 19.4% in Recall@5 and 17.7% in nDCG@5 over previous state-of-the-art agent retrievers on the LiveMCPBench benchmark.

**Abstract:** Graph Chain-of-Thought (Graph-CoT) enables large language models (LLMs) to perform step-by-step reasoning over graph-structured knowledge, but existing pipelines suffer from low accuracy, excessive token usage, high latency, and low throughput due to single-agent monolithic prompts, repeated context re-encoding, and inefficient serving execution. We present GLM, the first multi-agent Graph-CoT system co-designed with an optimized LLM serving architecture. GLM decomposes reasoning into specialized agents for classification, reasoning, action generation, and graph retrieval, enabling branching and selective context sharing to reduce prompt length and reasoning iterations while preserving reasoning quality, thereby improving accuracy and reducing overall token consumption. To scale inference, we introduce a Graph-CoT-aware LLM inference mechanism with graph-specific KV-cache management, priority-based eviction, and pipelined execution to improve serving efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that GLM improves answer accuracy by up to 38%, reduces token cost by up to 95.7%, lowers inference latency by 90.3%, and achieves up to 15.1x higher throughput compared to state-of-the-art Graph-CoT baselines, enabling efficient adoption for complex real-world reasoning at scale.

<summary><strong>GauDP: Reinventing Multi-Agent Collaboration through Gaussian-Image Synergy in Diffusion Policies</strong> - Ziye Wang, Li Kang, Yiran Qin, Jiahua Ma, Zhanglin Peng, Lei Bai, Ruimao Zhang - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.00998)</summary>

**Abstract:** Recently, effective coordination in embodied multi-agent systems has remained a fundamental challenge, particularly in scenarios where agents must balance individual perspectives with global environmental awareness. Existing approaches often struggle to balance fine-grained local control with comprehensive scene understanding, resulting in limited scalability and compromised collaboration quality. In this paper, we present GauDP, a novel Gaussian-image synergistic representation that facilitates scalable, perception-aware imitation learning in multi-agent collaborative systems. Specifically, GauDP constructs a globally consistent 3D Gaussian field from decentralized RGB observations, then dynamically redistributes 3D Gaussian attributes to each agent's local perspective. This enables all agents to adaptively query task-critical features from the shared scene representation while maintaining their individual viewpoints. This design facilitates both fine-grained control and globally coherent behavior without requiring additional sensing modalities (e.g., 3D point cloud). We evaluate GauDP on the RoboFactory benchmark, which includes diverse multi-arm manipulation tasks. Our method achieves superior performance over existing image-based methods and approaches the effectiveness of point-cloud-driven methods, while maintaining strong scalability as the number of agents increases.

<summary><strong>MARS: Multi-Agent Robotic System with Multimodal Large Language Models for Assistive Intelligence</strong> - Renjun Gao, Peiyan Zhong - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.01594)</summary>

**Abstract:** Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in cross-modal understanding and reasoning, offering new opportunities for intelligent assistive systems, yet existing systems still struggle with risk-aware planning, user personalization, and grounding language plans into executable skills in cluttered homes. We introduce MARS - a Multi-Agent Robotic System powered by MLLMs for assistive intelligence and designed for smart home robots supporting people with disabilities. The system integrates four agents: a visual perception agent for extracting semantic and spatial features from environment images, a risk assessment agent for identifying and prioritizing hazards, a planning agent for generating executable action sequences, and an evaluation agent for iterative optimization. By combining multimodal perception with hierarchical multi-agent decision-making, the framework enables adaptive, risk-aware, and personalized assistance in dynamic indoor environments. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the superior overall performance of the proposed system in risk-aware planning and coordinated multi-agent execution compared with state-of-the-art multimodal models. The proposed approach also highlights the potential of collaborative AI for practical assistive scenarios and provides a generalizable methodology for deploying MLLM-enabled multi-agent systems in real-world environments.

<summary><strong>A Time-dependent Risk-aware distributed Multi-Agent Path Finder based on A*</strong> - S Nordström, Y Bai, B Lindqvist, G Nikolakopoulos - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.19593)</summary>

**Abstract:** Multi-Agent Path-Finding (MAPF) focuses on the collaborative planning of paths for multiple agents within shared spaces, aiming for collision-free navigation. Conventional planning methods often overlook the presence of other agents, which can result in conflicts. In response, this article introduces the A$^*_+$T algorithm, a distributed approach that improves coordination among agents by anticipating their positions based on their movement speeds. The algorithm also considers dynamic obstacles, assessing potential collisions with respect to observed speeds and trajectories, thereby facilitating collision-free path planning in environments populated by other agents and moving objects. It incorporates a risk layer surrounding both dynamic and static entities, enhancing its utility in real-world applications. Each agent functions autonomously while being mindful of the paths chosen by others, effectively addressing the complexities inherent in multi-agent situations. The performance of A$^*_+$T has been rigorously tested in the Gazebo simulation environment and benchmarked against established approaches such as CBS, ECBS, and SIPP. Furthermore, the algorithm has shown competence in single-agent experiments, with results demonstrating its effectiveness in managing dynamic obstacles and affirming its practical relevance across various scenarios.

**Abstract:** Virtual Reality (VR) has rapidly become a mainstream platform for gaming and interactive experiences, yet ensuring the quality, safety, and appropriateness of VR content remains a pressing challenge. Traditional human-based quality assurance is labor-intensive and cannot scale with the industry's rapid growth. While automated testing has been applied to traditional 2D and 3D games, extending it to VR introduces unique difficulties due to high-dimensional sensory inputs and strict real-time performance requirements. We present VRScout, a deep learning-based agent capable of autonomously navigating VR environments and interacting with virtual objects in a human-like and real-time manner. VRScout learns from human demonstrations using an enhanced Action Chunking Transformer that predicts multi-step action sequences. This enables our agent to capture higher-level strategies and generalize across diverse environments. To balance responsiveness and precision, we introduce a dynamically adjustable sliding horizon that adapts the agent's temporal context at runtime. We evaluate VRScout on commercial VR titles and show that it achieves expert-level performance with only limited training data, while maintaining real-time inference at 60 FPS on consumer-grade hardware. These results position VRScout as a practical and scalable framework for automated VR game testing, with direct applications in both quality assurance and safety auditing.

<summary><strong>HAFixAgent: History-Aware Automated Program Repair Agent</strong> - Yu Shi, Hao Li, Bram Adams, Ahmed E. Hassan - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.01047)</summary>

**Abstract:** Automated program repair (APR) has recently shifted toward large language models and agent-based systems, yet most systems rely on local snapshot context, overlooking repository history. Prior work shows that repository history helps repair single-line bugs, since the last commit touching the buggy line is often the bug-introducing one. In this paper, we investigate whether repository history can also improve agentic APR systems at scale, especially for complex multi-hunk bugs. We present HAFixAgent, a History-Aware Bug-Fixing Agent that injects blame-derived repository heuristics into its repair loop. A preliminary study of all 854 real-world bugs from Defects4J motivates our design, showing that bug-relevant history is both widely available and highly concentrated. Empirical comparison of HAFixAgent with two state-of-the-art baselines shows: (1) Effectiveness: HAFixAgent significantly improves over the agent-based baseline (by 212.3%) and the multi-hunk baseline (by 29.9%). (2) Efficiency: history does not significantly increase agent steps and keeps token costs comparable, with notably lower median costs for complex multi-file-multi-hunk bugs. (3) Practicality: combining different historical heuristics repairs more bugs, offering a clear cost-benefit trade-off. HAFixAgent offers a practical recipe for history-aware agentic APR: ground the agent in version control history, prioritize diff-based historical context, and integrate complementary heuristics when needed.

<summary><strong>Tree Training: Accelerating Agentic LLMs Training via Shared Prefix Reuse</strong> - Shaojie Wang, Jinghui Wang, Yinghan Cui, Xuxing Chen, Chao Wang, Liang Huang, Xiaojiang Zhang, Junyi Peng, Li Wan, Haotian Zhang, Bin Chen - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.00413)</summary>

**Abstract:** In agentic LLM scenarios, an agent's interaction process during a single rollout often exhibits branching behaviors. Due to memory retrieval and concurrent tool executions at certain decision points, the token trajectory of one task evolves into a tree-like structure rather than a linear sequence. However, current training pipelines decompose such tree-structured trajectories into separate linear segments, treating each branch as an independent sequence. As a result, shared prefixes across these branches are repeatedly recomputed during both forward and backward passes. To address this inefficiency, we propose Tree Training, a paradigm that computes each shared prefix only once and reuses its intermediate results across related branches during both forward and backward passes, substantially improving computation efficiency in large-scale agentic training. This is achieved via (i) Tree Packing, which efficiently reuses shared computations across trajectories, and (ii) Gradient Restoration, which ensures correct gradient propagation across reused prefixes. Experiments on multiple open-source models demonstrate up to 3.9x reduction in total training time, enabling more efficient agentic LLM SFT and RL training.

<summary><strong>Multi-Mapcher: Loop Closure Detection-Free Heterogeneous LiDAR Multi-Session SLAM Leveraging Outlier-Robust Registration for Autonomous Vehicles</strong> - Hyungtae Lim, Daebeom Kim, Hyun Myung - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.00635)</summary>

**Abstract:** As various 3D light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors have been introduced to the market, research on multi-session simultaneous localization and mapping (MSS) using heterogeneous LiDAR sensors has been actively conducted. Existing MSS methods mostly rely on loop closure detection for inter-session alignment; however, the performance of loop closure detection can be potentially degraded owing to the differences in the density and field of view (FoV) of the sensors used in different sessions. In this study, we challenge the existing paradigm that relies heavily on loop detection modules and propose a novel MSS framework, called Multi-Mapcher, that employs large-scale map-to-map registration to perform inter-session initial alignment, which is commonly assumed to be infeasible, by leveraging outlier-robust 3D point cloud registration. Next, after finding inter-session loops by radius search based on the assumption that the inter-session initial alignment is sufficiently precise, anchor node-based robust pose graph optimization is employed to build a consistent global map. As demonstrated in our experiments, our approach shows substantially better MSS performance for various LiDAR sensors used to capture the sessions and is faster than state-of-the-art approaches.

<summary><strong>When Semantics Connect the Swarm: LLM-Driven Fuzzy Control for Cooperative Multi-Robot Underwater Coverage</strong> - Jingzehua Xu, Weihang Zhang, Yangyang Li, Hongmiaoyi Zhang, Guanwen Xie, Jiwei Tang, Shuai Zhang, Yi Li - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.00783)</summary>

**Abstract:** Underwater multi-robot cooperative coverage remains challenging due to partial observability, limited communication, environmental uncertainty, and the lack of access to global localization. To address these issues, this paper presents a semantics-guided fuzzy control framework that couples Large Language Models (LLMs) with interpretable control and lightweight coordination. Raw multimodal observations are compressed by the LLM into compact, human-interpretable semantic tokens that summarize obstacles, unexplored regions, and Objects Of Interest (OOIs) under uncertain perception. A fuzzy inference system with pre-defined membership functions then maps these tokens into smooth and stable steering and gait commands, enabling reliable navigation without relying on global positioning. Then, we further coordinate multiple robots by introducing semantic communication that shares intent and local context in linguistic form, enabling agreement on who explores where while avoiding redundant revisits. Extensive simulations in unknown reef-like environments show that, under limited sensing and communication, the proposed framework achieves robust OOI-oriented navigation and cooperative coverage with improved efficiency and adaptability, narrowing the gap between semantic cognition and distributed underwater control in GPS-denied, map-free conditions.

<summary><strong>Don't Just Search, Understand: Semantic Path Planning Agent for Spherical Tensegrity Robots in Unknown Environments</strong> - Junwen Zhang, Changyue Liu, Pengqi Fu, Xiang Guo, Ye Shi, Xudong Liang, Zhijian Wang, Hanzhi Ma - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.01236)</summary>

**Abstract:** Endowed with inherent dynamical properties that grant them remarkable ruggedness and adaptability, spherical tensegrity robots stand as prototypical examples of hybrid softrigid designs and excellent mobile platforms. However, path planning for these robots in unknown environments presents a significant challenge, requiring a delicate balance between efficient exploration and robust planning. Traditional path planners, which treat the environment as a geometric grid, often suffer from redundant searches and are prone to failure in complex scenarios due to their lack of semantic understanding. To overcome these limitations, we reframe path planning in unknown environments as a semantic reasoning task. We introduce a Semantic Agent for Tensegrity robots (SATPlanner) driven by a Large Language Model (LLM). SATPlanner leverages high-level environmental comprehension to generate efficient and reliable planning this http URL the core of SATPlanner is an Adaptive Observation Window mechanism, inspired by the "fast" and "slow" thinking paradigms of LLMs. This mechanism dynamically adjusts the perceptual field of the agent: it narrows for rapid traversal of open spaces and expands to reason about complex obstacle configurations. This allows the agent to construct a semantic belief of the environment, enabling the search space to grow only linearly with the path length (O(L)) while maintaining path quality. We extensively evaluate SATPlanner in 1,000 simulation trials, where it achieves a 100% success rate, outperforming other real-time planning algorithms. Critically, SATPlanner reduces the search space by 37.2% compared to the A* algorithm while achieving comparable, near-optimal path lengths. Finally, the practical feasibility of SATPlanner is validated on a physical spherical tensegrity robot prototype.

<summary><strong>Saliency-Guided Domain Adaptation for Left-Hand Driving in Autonomous Steering</strong> - Zahra Mehraban, Sebastien Glaser, Michael Milford, Ronald Schroeter - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.01223)</summary>

**Abstract:** Domain adaptation is required for automated driving models to generalize well across diverse road conditions. This paper explores a training method for domain adaptation to adapt PilotNet, an end-to-end deep learning-based model, for left-hand driving conditions using real-world Australian highway data. Four training methods were evaluated: (1) a baseline model trained on U.S. right-hand driving data, (2) a model trained on flipped U.S. data, (3) a model pretrained on U.S. data and then fine-tuned on Australian highways, and (4) a model pretrained on flipped U.S. data and then finetuned on Australian highways. This setup examines whether incorporating flipped data enhances the model adaptation by providing an initial left-hand driving alignment. The paper compares model performance regarding steering prediction accuracy and attention, using saliency-based analysis to measure attention shifts across significant road regions. Results show that pretraining on flipped data alone worsens prediction stability due to misaligned feature representations, but significantly improves adaptation when followed by fine-tuning, leading to lower prediction error and stronger focus on left-side cues. To validate this approach across different architectures, the same experiments were done on ResNet, which confirmed similar adaptation trends. These findings emphasize the importance of preprocessing techniques, such as flipped-data pretraining, followed by fine-tuning to improve model adaptation with minimal retraining requirements.

<summary><strong>Modulation of temporal decision-making in a deep reinforcement learning agent under the dual-task paradigm</strong> - Amrapali Pednekar, Álvaro Garrido-Pérez, Yara Khaluf, Pieter Simoens - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.01415)</summary>

**Abstract:** This study explores the interference in temporal processing within a dual-task paradigm from an artificial intelligence (AI) perspective. In this context, the dual-task setup is implemented as a simplified version of the Overcooked environment with two variations, single task (T) and dual task (T+N). Both variations involve an embedded time production task, but the dual task (T+N) additionally involves a concurrent number comparison task. Two deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents were separately trained for each of these tasks. These agents exhibited emergent behavior consistent with human timing research. Specifically, the dual task (T+N) agent exhibited significant overproduction of time relative to its single task (T) counterpart. This result was consistent across four target durations. Preliminary analysis of neural dynamics in the agents' LSTM layers did not reveal any clear evidence of a dedicated or intrinsic timer. Hence, further investigation is needed to better understand the underlying time-keeping mechanisms of the agents and to provide insights into the observed behavioral patterns. This study is a small step towards exploring parallels between emergent DRL behavior and behavior observed in biological systems in order to facilitate a better understanding of both.

<summary><strong>Learning to Seek Evidence: A Verifiable Reasoning Agent with Causal Faithfulness Analysis</strong> - Yuhang Huang, Zekai Lin, Fan Zhong, Lei Liu - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.01425)</summary>

**Abstract:** Explanations for AI models in high-stakes domains like medicine often lack verifiability, which can hinder trust. To address this, we propose an interactive agent that produces explanations through an auditable sequence of actions. The agent learns a policy to strategically seek external visual evidence to support its diagnostic reasoning. This policy is optimized using reinforcement learning, resulting in a model that is both efficient and generalizable. Our experiments show that this action-based reasoning process significantly improves calibrated accuracy, reducing the Brier score by 18\% compared to a non-interactive baseline. To validate the faithfulness of the agent's explanations, we introduce a causal intervention method. By masking the visual evidence the agent chooses to use, we observe a measurable degradation in its performance ($\Delta$Brier=+0.029), confirming that the evidence is integral to its decision-making process. Our work provides a practical framework for building AI systems with verifiable and faithful reasoning capabilities.

**Abstract:** End-to-end architectures trained via imitation learning have advanced autonomous driving by scaling model size and data, yet performance remains brittle in safety-critical long-tail scenarios where supervision is sparse and causal understanding is limited. To address this, we introduce Alpamayo-R1 (AR1), a vision-language-action model (VLA) that integrates Chain of Causation reasoning with trajectory planning to enhance decision-making in complex driving scenarios. Our approach features three key innovations: (1) the Chain of Causation (CoC) dataset, built through a hybrid auto-labeling and human-in-the-loop pipeline producing decision-grounded, causally linked reasoning traces aligned with driving behaviors; (2) a modular VLA architecture combining Cosmos-Reason, a Vision-Language Model pre-trained for Physical AI applications, with a diffusion-based trajectory decoder that generates dynamically feasible plans in real time; (3) a multi-stage training strategy using supervised fine-tuning to elicit reasoning and reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize reasoning quality via large reasoning model feedback and enforce reasoning-action consistency. Evaluation shows AR1 achieves up to a 12% improvement in planning accuracy on challenging cases compared to a trajectory-only baseline, with a 35% reduction in off-road rate and 25% reduction in close encounter rate in closed-loop simulation. RL post-training improves reasoning quality by 45% as measured by a large reasoning model critic and reasoning-action consistency by 37%. Model scaling from 0.5B to 7B parameters shows consistent improvements. On-vehicle road tests confirm real-time performance (99 ms latency) and successful urban deployment. By bridging interpretable reasoning with precise control, AR1 demonstrates a practical path towards Level 4 autonomous driving. We plan to release AR1 models and a subset of the CoC in a future update.

**Abstract:** This report presents Pelican-VL 1.0, a new family of open-source embodied brain models with parameter scales ranging from 7 billion to 72 billion. Our explicit mission is clearly stated as: To embed powerful intelligence into various embodiments. Pelican-VL 1.0 is currently the largest-scale open-source embodied multimodal brain model. Its core advantage lies in the in-depth integration of data power and intelligent adaptive learning mechanisms. Specifically, metaloop distilled a high-quality dataset from a raw dataset containing 4+ billion tokens. Pelican-VL 1.0 is trained on a large-scale cluster of 1000+ A800 GPUs, consuming over 50k+ A800 GPU-hours per checkpoint. This translates to a 20.3% performance uplift from its base model and outperforms 100B-level open-source counterparts by 10.6%, placing it on par with leading proprietary systems on well-known embodied benchmarks. We establish a novel framework, DPPO (Deliberate Practice Policy Optimization), inspired by human metacognition to train Pelican-VL 1.0. We operationalize this as a metaloop that teaches the AI to practice deliberately, which is a RL-Refine-Diagnose-SFT loop.

**Abstract:** Cardiac ultrasound (US) is among the most widely used diagnostic tools in cardiology for assessing heart health, but its effectiveness is limited by operator dependence, time constraints, and human error. The shortage of trained professionals, especially in remote areas, further restricts access. These issues underscore the need for automated solutions that can ensure consistent, and accessible cardiac imaging regardless of operator skill or location. Recent progress in artificial intelligence (AI), especially in deep reinforcement learning (DRL), has gained attention for enabling autonomous decision-making. However, existing DRL-based approaches to cardiac US scanning lack reproducibility, rely on proprietary data, and use simplified models. Motivated by these gaps, we present the first end-to-end framework that integrates generative AI and DRL to enable autonomous and reproducible cardiac US scanning. The framework comprises two components: (i) a conditional generative simulator combining Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), that models the cardiac US environment producing realistic action-conditioned images; and (ii) a DRL module that leverages this simulator to learn autonomous, accurate scanning policies. The proposed framework delivers AI-driven guidance through expert-validated models that classify image type and assess quality, supports conditional generation of realistic US images, and establishes a reproducible foundation extendable to other organs. To ensure reproducibility, a publicly available dataset of real cardiac US scans is released. The solution is validated through several experiments. The VAE-GAN is benchmarked against existing GAN variants, with performance assessed using qualitative and quantitative approaches, while the DRL-based scanning system is evaluated under varying configurations to demonstrate effectiveness.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to simulate human users in interactive settings such as therapy, education, and social role-play. While these simulations enable scalable training and evaluation of AI agents, off-the-shelf LLMs often drift from their assigned personas, contradict earlier statements, or abandon role-appropriate behavior. We introduce a unified framework for evaluating and improving persona consistency in LLM-generated dialogue. We define three automatic metrics: prompt-to-line consistency, line-to-line consistency, and Q&A consistency, that capture different types of persona drift and validate each against human annotations. Using these metrics as reward signals, we apply multi-turn reinforcement learning to fine-tune LLMs for three user roles: a patient, a student, and a social chat partner. Our method reduces inconsistency by over 55%, resulting in more coherent and faithful simulated users.

<summary><strong>Efficient Reinforcement Learning for Large Language Models with Intrinsic Exploration</strong> - Yan Sun, Jia Guo, Stanley Kok, Zihao Wang, Zujie Wen, Zhiqiang Zhang - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.00794)</summary>

**Abstract:** Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has improved the reasoning ability of large language models, yet training remains costly because many rollouts contribute little to optimization, considering the amount of computation required. This study investigates how simply leveraging intrinsic data properties, almost free benefit during training, can improve data efficiency for RLVR. We propose PREPO with two complementary components. First, we adopt prompt perplexity as an indicator of model adaptability in learning, enabling the model to progress from well-understood contexts to more challenging ones. Second, we amplify the discrepancy among the rollouts by differentiating their relative entropy, and prioritize sequences that exhibit a higher degree of exploration. Together, these mechanisms reduce rollout demand while preserving competitive performance. On the Qwen and Llama models, PREPO achieves effective results on mathematical reasoning benchmarks with up to 3 times fewer rollouts than the baselines. Beyond empirical gains, we provide theoretical and in-depth analyses explaining the underlying rationale of our method to improve the data efficiency of RLVR.

<summary><strong>Logic-informed reinforcement learning for cross-domain optimization of large-scale cyber-physical systems</strong> - Guangxi Wan, Peng Zeng, Xiaoting Dong, Chunhe Song, Shijie Cui, Dong Li, Qingwei Dong, Yiyang Liu, Hongfei Bai - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.00806)</summary>

**Abstract:** Cyber-physical systems (CPS) require the joint optimization of discrete cyber actions and continuous physical parameters under stringent safety logic constraints. However, existing hierarchical approaches often compromise global optimality, whereas reinforcement learning (RL) in hybrid action spaces often relies on brittle reward penalties, masking, or shielding and struggles to guarantee constraint satisfaction. We present logic-informed reinforcement learning (LIRL), which equips standard policy-gradient algorithms with projection that maps a low-dimensional latent action onto the admissible hybrid manifold defined on-the-fly by first-order logic. This guarantees feasibility of every exploratory step without penalty tuning. Experimental evaluations have been conducted across multiple scenarios, including industrial manufacturing, electric vehicle charging stations, and traffic signal control, in all of which the proposed method outperforms existing hierarchical optimization approaches. Taking a robotic reducer assembly system in industrial manufacturing as an example, LIRL achieves a 36.47\% to 44.33\% reduction at most in the combined makespan-energy objective compared to conventional industrial hierarchical scheduling methods. Meanwhile, it consistently maintains zero constraint violations and significantly surpasses state-of-the-art hybrid-action reinforcement learning baselines. Thanks to its declarative logic-based constraint formulation, the framework can be seamlessly transferred to other domains such as smart transportation and smart grid, thereby paving the way for safe and real-time optimization in large-scale CPS.

**Abstract:** Test-time reinforcement learning (TTRL) offers a label-free paradigm for adapting models using only synthetic signals at inference, but its success hinges on constructing reliable learning signals. Standard approaches such as majority voting often collapse to spurious yet popular answers. We introduce Self-Harmony, a framework built on a simple intuition: the correct answer should remain stable across both an original question and its paraphrase. Self-Harmony operationalizes this by employing a single model in two complementary roles: a Solver to produce answers and a Reframer to rephrase the input. Based on this, we further propose a pseudo-label method: instead of majority voting, it aggregates answer frequencies across these original and reframed views using the harmonic mean. This is a process that naturally selects for solutions stable under reframing, thereby avoiding the common trap of favoring view-dependent, spurious answers. Crucially, this requires no human supervision or auxiliary models. Across diverse reasoning benchmarks, Self-Harmony achieves state-of-the-art results at the label-free test-time setting, ranking first in 28 of 30 settings across multiple methods. Beyond accuracy, it demonstrates unprecedented robustness, with zero training failures in all experiments, underscoring its stability and reliability.

**Abstract:** Traditional cybersecurity tabletop exercises (TTXs) provide valuable training but are often scripted, resource-intensive, and difficult to scale. We introduce AgentBnB, a browser-based re-imagining of the Backdoors & Breaches game that integrates large language model teammates with a Bloom-aligned, retrieval-augmented copilot (C2D2). The system expands a curated corpus into factual, conceptual, procedural, and metacognitive snippets, delivering on-demand, cognitively targeted hints. Prompt-engineered agents employ a scaffolding ladder that gradually fades as learner confidence grows. In a solo-player pilot with four graduate students, participants reported greater intention to use the agent-based version compared to the physical card deck and viewed it as more scalable, though a ceiling effect emerged on a simple knowledge quiz. Despite limitations of small sample size, single-player focus, and narrow corpus, these early findings suggest that large language model augmented TTXs can provide lightweight, repeatable practice without the logistical burden of traditional exercises. Planned extensions include multi-player modes, telemetry-driven coaching, and comparative studies with larger cohorts.

<summary><strong>Prompt-R1: Collaborative Automatic Prompting Framework via End-to-end Reinforcement Learning</strong> - Wenjin Liu, Haoran Luo, Xueyuan Lin, Haoming Liu, Tiesunlong Shen, Jiapu Wang, Rui Mao, Erik Cambria - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.01016)</summary>

**Abstract:** Recently, advanced large language models (LLMs) have emerged at an increasingly rapid pace. However, when faced with complex problems, most users are often unable to provide accurate and effective prompts to interact with LLMs, thus limiting the performance of LLMs. To address this challenge, we propose Prompt-R1, an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework that uses a small-scale LLM to collaborate with large-scale LLMs, replacing user interaction to solve problems better. This collaboration is cast as a multi-turn prompt interaction, where the small-scale LLM thinks and generates prompts, and the large-scale LLM performs complex reasoning. A dual-constrained reward is designed to optimize for correctness, generation quality, and reasoning accuracy. Prompt-R1 provides a plug-and-play framework that supports both inference and training with various large-scale LLMs. Experiments on multiple public datasets show that Prompt-R1 significantly outperforms baseline models across tasks.

<summary><strong>HarnessLLM: Automatic Testing Harness Generation via Reinforcement Learning</strong> - Yujian Liu, Jiabao Ji, Yang Zhang, Wenbo Guo, Tommi Jaakkola, Shiyu Chang - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.01104)</summary>

**Abstract:** Existing LLM-based automatic test generation methods mainly produce input and expected output pairs to categorize the intended behavior of correct programs. Although straightforward, these methods have limited diversity in generated tests and cannot provide enough debugging information. We propose HarnessLLM, a two-stage training pipeline that enables LLMs to write harness code for testing. Particularly, LLMs generate code that synthesizes inputs and validates the observed outputs, allowing complex test cases and flexible output validation such as invariant checking. To achieve this, we train LLMs with SFT followed by RLVR with a customized reward design. Experiments show that HarnessLLM outperforms input-output-based testing in bug finding and testing strategy diversity. HarnessLLM further benefits the code generation performance through test-time scaling with our generated test cases as inference-phase validation. Our code is available at this https URL.

<summary><strong>RLAC: Reinforcement Learning with Adversarial Critic for Free-Form Generation Tasks</strong> - Mian Wu, Gavin Zhang, Sewon Min, Sergey Levine, Aviral Kumar - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.01758)</summary>

**Abstract:** Open-ended generation tasks require outputs to satisfy diverse and often implicit task-specific evaluation rubrics. The sheer number of relevant rubrics leads to prohibitively high verification costs and incomplete assessments of a response, making reinforcement learning (RL) post-training with rubric-based rewards difficult to scale. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that often the best way to combine these rubrics into one single reward is also highly prompt-specific. We propose Reinforcement Learning with Adversarial Critic (RLAC), a post-training approach that addresses these challenges via dynamic rubric verification. Our approach employs a large language model (LLM) as a critic that dynamically identifies only the most likely failure modes (e.g., a factual error or unhandled edge case), which are then verified by an external validator to optimize both generator and critic jointly. By training both the generator and the critic, this game enhances the critic's error detection and the generator's output quality while reducing required verifications. Our experiments demonstrate that RLAC improves factual accuracy in text generation and correctness in code generation, while also outperforming exhaustive verification and reward model methods. We show that dynamic critics are more effective than fixed critics, showcasing the potential of RLAC for scaling RL post-training to free-form generation tasks.

<summary><strong>SlideAgent: Hierarchical Agentic Framework for Multi-Page Visual Document Understanding</strong> - Yiqiao Jin, Rachneet Kaur, Zhen Zeng, Sumitra Ganesh, Srijan Kumar - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.26615)</summary>

**Abstract:** Multi-page visual documents such as manuals, brochures, presentations, and posters convey key information through layout, colors, icons, and cross-slide references. While large language models (LLMs) offer opportunities in document understanding, current systems struggle with complex, multi-page visual documents, particularly in fine-grained reasoning over elements and pages. We introduce SlideAgent, a versatile agentic framework for understanding multi-modal, multi-page, and multi-layout documents, especially slide decks. SlideAgent employs specialized agents and decomposes reasoning into three specialized levels-global, page, and element-to construct a structured, query-agnostic representation that captures both overarching themes and detailed visual or textual cues. During inference, SlideAgent selectively activates specialized agents for multi-level reasoning and integrates their outputs into coherent, context-aware answers. Extensive experiments show that SlideAgent achieves significant improvement over both proprietary (+7.9 overall) and open-source models (+9.8 overall).

<summary><strong>Curriculum Reinforcement Learning from Easy to Hard Tasks Improves LLM Reasoning</strong> - Shubham Parashar, Shurui Gui, Xiner Li, Hongyi Ling, Sushil Vemuri, Blake Olson, Eric Li, Yu Zhang, James Caverlee, Dileep Kalathil, Shuiwang Ji - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.06632)</summary>

**Abstract:** We aim to improve the reasoning capabilities of language models via reinforcement learning (RL). Recent RL post-trained models like DeepSeek-R1 have demonstrated reasoning abilities on mathematical and coding tasks. However, prior studies suggest that using RL alone to improve reasoning on inherently difficult tasks is less effective. Here, we draw inspiration from curriculum learning and propose to schedule tasks from easy to hard (E2H), allowing LLMs to build reasoning skills gradually. Our method is termed E2H Reasoner. Empirically, we observe that, although easy tasks are important initially, fading them out through appropriate scheduling is essential in preventing overfitting. Theoretically, we establish convergence guarantees for E2H Reasoner within an approximate policy iteration framework. We derive finite-sample complexity bounds and show that when tasks are appropriately decomposed and conditioned, learning through curriculum stages requires fewer total samples than direct learning. Experiments across multiple domains show that E2H Reasoner significantly improves the reasoning ability of small LLMs (1.5B to 3B), which otherwise struggle when trained with vanilla RL alone, highlighting the effectiveness of our method.

<summary><strong>Token-Regulated Group Relative Policy Optimization for Stable Reinforcement Learning in Large Language Models</strong> - Tue Le, Nghi D.Q.Bui, Linh Ngo Van, Trung Le - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.00066)</summary>

**Abstract:** Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a powerful approach for strengthening the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Among existing algorithms, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has demonstrated strong performance, yet it suffers from a critical issue: low-probability tokens disproportionately dominate gradient updates due to their inherently large gradient magnitudes. This imbalance leads to unstable training and suppresses the contribution of high-probability tokens that are more reliable for learning. In this work, we introduce Token-Regulated Group Relative Policy Optimization (TR-GRPO), a simple yet effective extension of GRPO that assigns token-level weights positively correlated with the model's predicted probability. By downweighting low-probability tokens and emphasizing high-probability ones, TR-GRPO mitigates gradient over-amplification while preserving informative learning signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TR-GRPO consistently outperforms GRPO across RLVR tasks, including logic, math, and agentic reasoning, highlighting the importance of regulating token contributions during RL training and establishing TR-GRPO as a robust framework for enhancing LLM reasoning.

<summary><strong>Study on Supply Chain Finance Decision-Making Model and Enterprise Economic Performance Prediction Based on Deep Reinforcement Learning</strong> - Shiman Zhang, Jinghan Zhou, Zhoufan Yu, Ningai Leng - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.00166)</summary>

**Abstract:** To improve decision-making and planning efficiency in back-end centralized redundant supply chains, this paper proposes a decision model integrating deep learning with intelligent particle swarm optimization. A distributed node deployment model and optimal planning path are constructed for the supply chain network. Deep learning such as convolutional neural networks extracts features from historical data, and linear programming captures high-order statistical features. The model is optimized using fuzzy association rule scheduling and deep reinforcement learning, while neural networks fit dynamic changes. A hybrid mechanism of "deep learning feature extraction - intelligent particle swarm optimization" guides global optimization and selects optimal decisions for adaptive control. Simulations show reduced resource consumption, enhanced spatial planning, and in dynamic environments improved real-time decision adjustment, distribution path optimization, and robust intelligent control.

<summary><strong>Improving the Robustness of Control of Chaotic Convective Flows with Domain-Informed Reinforcement Learning</strong> - Michiel Straat, Thorben Markmann, Sebastian Peitz, Barbara Hammer - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.00272)</summary>

**Abstract:** Chaotic convective flows arise in many real-world systems, such as microfluidic devices and chemical reactors. Stabilizing these flows is highly desirable but remains challenging, particularly in chaotic regimes where conventional control methods often fail. Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown promise for control in laminar flow settings, but its ability to generalize and remain robust under chaotic and turbulent dynamics is not well explored, despite being critical for real-world deployment. In this work, we improve the practical feasibility of RL-based control of such flows focusing on Rayleigh-Bénard Convection (RBC), a canonical model for convective heat transport. To enhance generalization and sample efficiency, we introduce domain-informed RL agents that are trained using Proximal Policy Optimization across diverse initial conditions and flow regimes. We incorporate domain knowledge in the reward function via a term that encourages Bénard cell merging, as an example of a desirable macroscopic property. In laminar flow regimes, the domain-informed RL agents reduce convective heat transport by up to 33%, and in chaotic flow regimes, they still achieve a 10% reduction, which is significantly better than the conventional controllers used in practice. We compare the domain-informed to uninformed agents: Our results show that the domain-informed reward design results in steady flows, faster convergence during training, and generalization across flow regimes without retraining. Our work demonstrates that elegant domain-informed priors can greatly enhance the robustness of RL-based control of chaotic flows, bringing real-world deployment closer.

<summary><strong>Equilibrium Policy Generalization: A Reinforcement Learning Framework for Cross-Graph Zero-Shot Generalization in Pursuit-Evasion Games</strong> - Runyu Lu, Peng Zhang, Ruochuan Shi, Yuanheng Zhu, Dongbin Zhao, Yang Liu, Dong Wang, Cesare Alippi - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.00811)</summary>

**Abstract:** Equilibrium learning in adversarial games is an important topic widely examined in the fields of game theory and reinforcement learning (RL). Pursuit-evasion game (PEG), as an important class of real-world games from the fields of robotics and security, requires exponential time to be accurately solved. When the underlying graph structure varies, even the state-of-the-art RL methods require recomputation or at least fine-tuning, which can be time-consuming and impair real-time applicability. This paper proposes an Equilibrium Policy Generalization (EPG) framework to effectively learn a generalized policy with robust cross-graph zero-shot performance. In the context of PEGs, our framework is generally applicable to both pursuer and evader sides in both no-exit and multi-exit scenarios. These two generalizability properties, to our knowledge, are the first to appear in this domain. The core idea of the EPG framework is to train an RL policy across different graph structures against the equilibrium policy for each single graph. To construct an equilibrium oracle for single-graph policies, we present a dynamic programming (DP) algorithm that provably generates pure-strategy Nash equilibrium with near-optimal time complexity. To guarantee scalability with respect to pursuer number, we further extend DP and RL by designing a grouping mechanism and a sequence model for joint policy decomposition, respectively. Experimental results show that, using equilibrium guidance and a distance feature proposed for cross-graph PEG training, the EPG framework guarantees desirable zero-shot performance in various unseen real-world graphs. Besides, when trained under an equilibrium heuristic proposed for the graphs with exits, our generalized pursuer policy can even match the performance of the fine-tuned policies from the state-of-the-art PEG methods.

<summary><strong>What's the next frontier for Data-centric AI? Data Savvy Agents</strong> - Nabeel Seedat, Jiashuo Liu, Mihaela van der Schaar - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.01015)</summary>

**Abstract:** The recent surge in AI agents that autonomously communicate, collaborate with humans and use diverse tools has unlocked promising opportunities in various real-world settings. However, a vital aspect remains underexplored: how agents handle data. Scalable autonomy demands agents that continuously acquire, process, and evolve their data. In this paper, we argue that data-savvy capabilities should be a top priority in the design of agentic systems to ensure reliable real-world deployment. Specifically, we propose four key capabilities to realize this vision: (1) Proactive data acquisition: enabling agents to autonomously gather task-critical knowledge or solicit human input to address data gaps; (2) Sophisticated data processing: requiring context-aware and flexible handling of diverse data challenges and inputs; (3) Interactive test data synthesis: shifting from static benchmarks to dynamically generated interactive test data for agent evaluation; and (4) Continual adaptation: empowering agents to iteratively refine their data and background knowledge to adapt to shifting environments. While current agent research predominantly emphasizes reasoning, we hope to inspire a reflection on the role of data-savvy agents as the next frontier in data-centric AI.

<summary><strong>Optimizing Electric Vehicle Charging Station Placement Using Reinforcement Learning and Agent-Based Simulations</strong> - Minh-Duc Nguyen, Dung D. Le, Phi Long Nguyen - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.01218)</summary>

**Abstract:** The rapid growth of electric vehicles (EVs) necessitates the strategic placement of charging stations to optimize resource utilization and minimize user inconvenience. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers an innovative approach to identifying optimal charging station locations; however, existing methods face challenges due to their deterministic reward systems, which limit efficiency. Because real-world conditions are dynamic and uncertain, a deterministic reward structure cannot fully capture the complexities of charging station placement. As a result, evaluation becomes costly and time-consuming, and less reflective of real-world scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework that integrates deep RL with agent-based simulations to model EV movement and estimate charging demand in real time. Our approach employs a hybrid RL agent with dual Q-networks to select optimal locations and configure charging ports, guided by a hybrid reward function that combines deterministic factors with simulation-derived feedback. Case studies in Hanoi, Vietnam, show that our method reduces average waiting times by 53.28% compared to the initial state, outperforming static baseline methods. This scalable and adaptive solution enhances EV infrastructure planning, effectively addressing real-world complexities and improving user experience.

<summary><strong>From Grounding to Manipulation: Case Studies of Foundation Model Integration in Embodied Robotic Systems</strong> - Xiuchao Sui, Daiying Tian, Qi Sun, Ruirui Chen, Dongkyu Choi, Kenneth Kwok, Soujanya Poria - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15685)</summary>

**Abstract:** Foundation models (FMs) are increasingly used to bridge language and action in embodied agents, yet the operational characteristics of different FM integration strategies remain under-explored -- particularly for complex instruction following and versatile action generation in changing environments. This paper examines three paradigms for building robotic systems: end-to-end vision-language-action (VLA) models that implicitly integrate perception and planning, and modular pipelines incorporating either vision-language models (VLMs) or multimodal large language models (LLMs). We evaluate these paradigms through two focused case studies: a complex instruction grounding task assessing fine-grained instruction understanding and cross-modal disambiguation, and an object manipulation task targeting skill transfer via VLA finetuning. Our experiments in zero-shot and few-shot settings reveal trade-offs in generalization and data efficiency. By exploring performance limits, we distill design implications for developing language-driven physical agents and outline emerging challenges and opportunities for FM-powered robotics in real-world conditions.

<summary><strong>RL-100: Performant Robotic Manipulation with Real-World Reinforcement Learning</strong> - Kun Lei, Huanyu Li, Dongjie Yu, Zhenyu Wei, Lingxiao Guo, Zhennan Jiang, Ziyu Wang, Shiyu Liang, Huazhe Xu - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.14830)</summary>

**Abstract:** Real-world robotic manipulation in homes and factories demands reliability, efficiency, and robustness that approach or surpass skilled human operators. We present RL-100, a real-world reinforcement learning training framework built on diffusion visuomotor policies trained by supervised learning. RL-100 introduces a three-stage pipeline. First, imitation learning leverages human priors. Second, iterative offline reinforcement learning uses an Offline Policy Evaluation procedure, abbreviated OPE, to gate PPO-style updates that are applied in the denoising process for conservative and reliable improvement. Third, online reinforcement learning eliminates residual failure modes. An additional lightweight consistency distillation head compresses the multi-step sampling process in diffusion into a single-step policy, enabling high-frequency control with an order-of-magnitude reduction in latency while preserving task performance. The framework is task-, embodiment-, and representation-agnostic and supports both 3D point clouds and 2D RGB inputs, a variety of robot platforms, and both single-step and action-chunk policies. We evaluate RL-100 on seven real-robot tasks spanning dynamic rigid-body control, such as Push-T and Agile Bowling, fluids and granular pouring, deformable cloth folding, precise dexterous unscrewing, and multi-stage orange juicing. RL-100 attains 100\% success across evaluated trials for a total of 900 out of 900 episodes, including up to 250 out of 250 consecutive trials on one task. The method achieves near-human teleoperation or better time efficiency and demonstrates multi-hour robustness with uninterrupted operation lasting up to two hours.

<summary><strong>Co-MTP: A Cooperative Trajectory Prediction Framework with Multi-Temporal Fusion for Autonomous Driving</strong> - Xinyu Zhang, Zewei Zhou, Zhaoyi Wang, Yangjie Ji, Yanjun Huang, Hong Chen - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.16589)</summary>

**Abstract:** Vehicle-to-everything technologies (V2X) have become an ideal paradigm to extend the perception range and see through the occlusion. Exiting efforts focus on single-frame cooperative perception, however, how to capture the temporal cue between frames with V2X to facilitate the prediction task even the planning task is still underexplored. In this paper, we introduce the Co-MTP, a general cooperative trajectory prediction framework with multi-temporal fusion for autonomous driving, which leverages the V2X system to fully capture the interaction among agents in both history and future domains to benefit the planning. In the history domain, V2X can complement the incomplete history trajectory in single-vehicle perception, and we design a heterogeneous graph transformer to learn the fusion of the history feature from multiple agents and capture the history interaction. Moreover, the goal of prediction is to support future planning. Thus, in the future domain, V2X can provide the prediction results of surrounding objects, and we further extend the graph transformer to capture the future interaction among the ego planning and the other vehicles' intentions and obtain the final future scenario state under a certain planning action. We evaluate the Co-MTP framework on the real-world dataset V2X-Seq, and the results show that Co-MTP achieves state-of-the-art performance and that both history and future fusion can greatly benefit prediction.

<summary><strong>"Less is More": Reducing Cognitive Load and Task Drift in Real-Time Multimodal Assistive Agents for the Visually Impaired</strong> - Yi Zhao, Siqi Wang, Qiqun Geng, Erxin Yu, Jing Li - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.00945)</summary>

**Abstract:** Vision-Language Models (VLMs) enable on-demand visual assistance, yet current applications for people with visual impairments (PVI) impose high cognitive load and exhibit task drift, limiting real-world utility. We first conducted a formative study with 15 PVI and identified three requirements for visually impaired assistance (VIA): low latency for real-time use, minimal cognitive load, and hallucination-resistant responses to sustain trust. Informed by the formative study, we present VIA-Agent, a prototype that co-optimizes its cognitive 'brain' and interactive 'body'. The brain implements a goal-persistent design with calibrated conciseness to produce brief, actionable guidance; the body adopts a real-time communication (RTC) embodiment-evolving from a request-response model Context Protocol (MCP) pipeline-to-support fluid interaction. We evaluated VIA-Agent with 9 PVI across navigation and object retrieval in the wild against BeMyAI and Doubao. VIA-Agent significantly outperformed BeMyAI both quantitatively and qualitatively. While achieving success rates comparable to Doubao, it reduced mean task time by 39.9% (70.1 s vs. 110.7 s), required fewer conversational turns (4.3 vs. 5.0), and lowered perceived cognitive load and task drift. System Usability Scale (SUS) results aligned with these findings, with VIA-Agent achieving the highest usability. We hope this work inspires the development of more human-centered VIA systems.

<summary><strong>When Machines Join the Moral Circle: The Persona Effect of Generative AI Agents in Collaborative Reasoning</strong> - Yueqiao Jin, Roberto Martinez-Maldonado, Wanruo Shi, Songjie Huang, Mingmin Zheng, Xinbin Han, Dragan Gasevic, Lixiang Yan - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.01205)</summary>

**Abstract:** Generative AI is increasingly positioned as a peer in collaborative learning, yet its effects on ethical deliberation remain unclear. We report a between-subjects experiment with university students (N=217) who discussed an autonomous-vehicle dilemma in triads under three conditions: human-only control, supportive AI teammate, or contrarian AI teammate. Using moral foundations lexicons, argumentative coding from the augmentative knowledge construction framework, semantic trajectory modelling with BERTopic and dynamic time warping, and epistemic network analysis, we traced how AI personas reshape moral discourse. Supportive AIs increased grounded/qualified claims relative to control, consolidating integrative reasoning around care/fairness, while contrarian AIs modestly broadened moral framing and sustained value pluralism. Both AI conditions reduced thematic drift compared with human-only groups, indicating more stable topical focus. Post-discussion justification complexity was only weakly predicted by moral framing and reasoning quality, and shifts in final moral decisions were driven primarily by participants' initial stance rather than condition. Overall, AI teammates altered the process, the distribution and connection of moral frames and argument quality, more than the outcome of moral choice, highlighting the potential of generative AI agents as teammates for eliciting reflective, pluralistic moral reasoning in collaborative learning.

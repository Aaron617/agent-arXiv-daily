<summary><strong>MEGA-GUI: Multi-stage Enhanced Grounding Agents for GUI Elements</strong> - SeokJoo Kwak, Jihoon Kim, Boyoun Kim, Jung Jae Yoon, Wooseok Jang, Jeonghoon Hong, Jaeho Yang, Yeong-Dae Kwon - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.13087)</summary>

**Abstract:** Graphical User Interface (GUI) grounding - the task of mapping natural language instructions to screen coordinates - is essential for autonomous agents and accessibility technologies. Existing systems rely on monolithic models or one-shot pipelines that lack modularity and fail under visual clutter and ambiguous instructions. We introduce MEGA-GUI, a multi-stage framework that separates grounding into coarse Region-of-Interest (ROI) selection and fine-grained element grounding, orchestrated by specialized vision-language agents. MEGA-GUI features a bidirectional ROI zoom algorithm that mitigates spatial dilution and a context-aware rewriting agent that reduces semantic ambiguity. Our analysis reveals complementary strengths and weaknesses across vision-language models at different visual scales, and we show that leveraging this modular structure achieves consistently higher accuracy than monolithic approaches. On the visually dense ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark, MEGA-GUI attains 73.18% accuracy, and on the semantically complex OSWorld-G benchmark it reaches 68.63%, surpassing previously reported results. Code and the Grounding Benchmark Toolkit (GBT) are available at this https URL.

<summary><strong>DIAP: A Decentralized Agent Identity Protocol with Zero-Knowledge Proofs and a Hybrid P2P Stack</strong> - Yuanjie Liu, Wenpeng Xing, Ye Zhou, Gaowei Chang, Changting Lin, Meng Han - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.11619)</summary>

**Abstract:** The absence of a fully decentralized, verifiable, and privacy-preserving communication protocol for autonomous agents remains a core challenge in decentralized computing. Existing systems often rely on centralized intermediaries, which reintroduce trust bottlenecks, or lack decentralized identity-resolution mechanisms, limiting persistence and cross-network interoperability.
We propose the Decentralized Interstellar Agent Protocol (DIAP), a novel framework for agent identity and communication that enables persistent, verifiable, and trustless interoperability in fully decentralized environments. DIAP binds an agent's identity to an immutable IPFS or IPNS content identifier and uses zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP) to dynamically and statelessly prove ownership, removing the need for record updates.
We present a Rust SDK that integrates Noir (for zero-knowledge proofs), DID-Key, IPFS, and a hybrid peer-to-peer stack combining Libp2p GossipSub for discovery and Iroh for high-performance, QUIC based data exchange. DIAP introduces a zero-dependency ZKP deployment model through a universal proof manager and compile-time build script that embeds a precompiled Noir circuit, eliminating the need for external ZKP toolchains. This enables instant, verifiable, and privacy-preserving identity proofs.
This work establishes a practical, high-performance foundation for next-generation autonomous agent ecosystems and agent-to-agent (A to A) economies.

<summary><strong>A Multimodal Manufacturing Safety Chatbot: Knowledge Base Design, Benchmark Development, and Evaluation of Multiple RAG Approaches</strong> - Ryan Singh, Austin Hamilton, Amanda White, Michael Wise, Ibrahim Yousif, Arthur Carvalho, Zhe Shan, Reza Abrisham Baf, Mohammad Mayyas, Lora A. Cavuoto, Fadel M. Megahed - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.11847)</summary>

**Abstract:** Ensuring worker safety remains a critical challenge in modern manufacturing environments. Industry 5.0 reorients the prevailing manufacturing paradigm toward more human-centric operations. Using a design science research methodology, we identify three essential requirements for next-generation safety training systems: high accuracy, low latency, and low cost. We introduce a multimodal chatbot powered by large language models that meets these design requirements. The chatbot uses retrieval-augmented generation to ground its responses in curated regulatory and technical documentation. To evaluate our solution, we developed a domain-specific benchmark of expert-validated question and answer pairs for three representative machines: a Bridgeport manual mill, a Haas TL-1 CNC lathe, and a Universal Robots UR5e collaborative robot. We tested 24 RAG configurations using a full-factorial design and assessed them with automated evaluations of correctness, latency, and cost. Our top 2 configurations were then evaluated by ten industry experts and academic researchers. Our results show that retrieval strategy and model configuration have a significant impact on performance. The top configuration (selected for chatbot deployment) achieved an accuracy of 86.66%, an average latency of 10.04 seconds, and an average cost of $0.005 per query. Overall, our work provides three contributions: an open-source, domain-grounded safety training chatbot; a validated benchmark for evaluating AI-assisted safety instruction; and a systematic methodology for designing and assessing AI-enabled instructional and immersive safety training systems for Industry 5.0 environments.

<summary><strong>ENGRAM: Effective, Lightweight Memory Orchestration for Conversational Agents</strong> - Daivik Patel, Shrenik Patel - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.12960)</summary>

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) deployed in user-facing applications require long-horizon consistency: the ability to remember prior interactions, respect user preferences, and ground reasoning in past events. However, contemporary memory systems often adopt complex architectures such as knowledge graphs, multi-stage retrieval pipelines, and OS-style schedulers, which introduce engineering complexity and reproducibility challenges. We present ENGRAM, a lightweight memory system that organizes conversation into three canonical memory types (episodic, semantic, and procedural) through a single router and retriever. Each user turn is converted into typed memory records with normalized schemas and embeddings and stored in a database. At query time, the system retrieves top-k dense neighbors for each type, merges results with simple set operations, and provides the most relevant evidence as context to the model. ENGRAM attains state-of-the-art results on LoCoMo, a multi-session conversational QA benchmark for long-horizon memory, and exceeds the full-context baseline by 15 points on LongMemEval while using only about 1% of the tokens. These results show that careful memory typing and straightforward dense retrieval can enable effective long-term memory management in language models without requiring complex architectures.

<summary><strong>Is Our Chatbot Telling Lies? Assessing Correctness of an LLM-based Dutch Support Chatbot</strong> - Herman Lassche, Michiel Overeem, Ayushi Rastogi - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.00034)</summary>

**Abstract:** Companies support their customers using live chats and chatbots to gain their loyalty. AFAS is a Dutch company aiming to leverage the opportunity large language models (LLMs) offer to answer customer queries with minimal to no input from its customer support team. Adding to its complexity, it is unclear what makes a response correct, and that too in Dutch. Further, with minimal data available for training, the challenge is to identify whether an answer generated by a large language model is correct and do it on the fly.
This study is the first to define the correctness of a response based on how the support team at AFAS makes decisions. It leverages literature on natural language generation and automated answer grading systems to automate the decision-making of the customer support team. We investigated questions requiring a binary response (e.g., Would it be possible to adjust tax rates manually?) or instructions (e.g., How would I adjust tax rate manually?) to test how close our automated approach reaches support rating. Our approach can identify wrong messages in 55\% of the cases. This work demonstrates the potential for automatically assessing when our chatbot may provide incorrect or misleading answers. Specifically, we contribute (1) a definition and metrics for assessing correctness, and (2) suggestions to improve correctness with respect to regional language and question type.

<summary><strong>Contextual Integrity in LLMs via Reasoning and Reinforcement Learning</strong> - Guangchen Lan, Huseyin A. Inan, Sahar Abdelnabi, Janardhan Kulkarni, Lukas Wutschitz, Reza Shokri, Christopher G. Brinton, Robert Sim - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04245)</summary>

**Abstract:** As the era of autonomous agents making decisions on behalf of users unfolds, ensuring contextual integrity (CI) -- what is the appropriate information to share while carrying out a certain task -- becomes a central question to the field. We posit that CI demands a form of reasoning where the agent needs to reason about the context in which it is operating. To test this, we first prompt LLMs to reason explicitly about CI when deciding what information to disclose. We then extend this approach by developing a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that further instills in models the reasoning necessary to achieve CI. Using a synthetic, automatically created, dataset of only $\sim700$ examples but with diverse contexts and information disclosure norms, we show that our method substantially reduces inappropriate information disclosure while maintaining task performance across multiple model sizes and families. Importantly, improvements transfer from this synthetic dataset to established CI benchmarks such as PrivacyLens that has human annotations and evaluates privacy leakage of AI assistants in actions and tool calls.

<summary><strong>An LLM-based Simulation Framework for Embodied Conversational Agents in Psychological Counseling</strong> - Lixiu Wu, Yuanrong Tang, Qisen Pan, Xianyang Zhan, Yucheng Han, Lanxi Xiao, Tianhong Wang, Chen Zhong, Jiangtao Gong - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.22041)</summary>

**Abstract:** Due to privacy concerns, open dialogue datasets for mental health are primarily generated through human or AI synthesis methods. However, the inherent implicit nature of psychological processes, particularly those of clients, poses challenges to the authenticity and diversity of synthetic data. In this paper, we propose ECAs (short for Embodied Conversational Agents), a framework for embodied agent simulation based on Large Language Models (LLMs) that incorporates multiple psychological theoretical this http URL simulation, we expand real counseling case data into a nuanced embodied cognitive memory space and generate dialogue data based on high-frequency counseling this http URL validated our framework using the D4 dataset. First, we created a public ECAs dataset through batch simulations based on D4. Licensed counselors evaluated our method, demonstrating that it significantly outperforms baselines in simulation authenticity and necessity. Additionally, two LLM-based automated evaluation methods were employed to confirm the higher quality of the generated dialogues compared to the baselines. The source code and dataset are available at this https URL.

<summary><strong>WebCoach: Self-Evolving Web Agents with Cross-Session Memory Guidance</strong> - Genglin Liu, Shijie Geng, Sha Li, Hejie Cui, Sarah Zhang, Xin Liu, Tianyi Liu - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.12997)</summary>

**Abstract:** Multimodal LLM-powered agents have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities in web navigation, enabling agents to complete complex browsing tasks across diverse domains. However, current agents struggle with repetitive errors and lack the ability to learn from past experiences across sessions, limiting their long-term robustness and sample efficiency. We introduce WebCoach, a model-agnostic self-evolving framework that equips web browsing agents with persistent cross-session memory, enabling improved long-term planning, reflection, and continual learning without retraining. WebCoach consists of three key components: (1) a WebCondenser, which standardizes raw navigation logs into concise summaries; (2) an External Memory Store, which organizes complete trajectories as episodic experiences; and (3) a Coach, which retrieves relevant experiences based on similarity and recency, and decides whether to inject task-specific advice into the agent via runtime hooks. This design empowers web agents to access long-term memory beyond their native context window, improving robustness in complex browsing tasks. Moreover, WebCoach achieves self-evolution by continuously curating episodic memory from new navigation trajectories, enabling agents to improve over time without retraining. Evaluations on the WebVoyager benchmark demonstrate that WebCoach consistently improves the performance of browser-use agents across three different LLM backbones. With a 38B model, it increases task success rates from 47% to 61% while reducing or maintaining the average number of steps. Notably, smaller base models with WebCoach achieve performance comparable to the same web agent using GPT-4o.

<summary><strong>DAP: A Discrete-token Autoregressive Planner for Autonomous Driving</strong> - Bowen Ye, Bin Zhang, Hang Zhao - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.13306)</summary>

**Abstract:** Gaining sustainable performance improvement with scaling data and model budget remains a pivotal yet unresolved challenge in autonomous driving. While autoregressive models exhibited promising data-scaling efficiency in planning tasks, predicting ego trajectories alone suffers sparse supervision and weakly constrains how scene evolution should shape ego motion. Therefore, we introduce DAP, a discrete-token autoregressive planner that jointly forecasts BEV semantics and ego trajectories, thereby enforcing comprehensive representation learning and allowing predicted dynamics to directly condition ego motion. In addition, we incorporate a reinforcement-learning-based fine-tuning, which preserves supervised behavior cloning priors while injecting reward-guided improvements. Despite a compact 160M parameter budget, DAP achieves state-of-the-art performance on open-loop metrics and delivers competitive closed-loop results on the NAVSIM benchmark. Overall, the fully discrete-token autoregressive formulation operating on both rasterized BEV and ego actions provides a compact yet scalable planning paradigm for autonomous driving.

<summary><strong>MedDCR: Learning to Design Agentic Workflows for Medical Coding</strong> - Jiyang Zheng, Islam Nassar, Thanh Vu, Xu Zhong, Yang Lin, Tongliang Liu, Long Duong, Yuan-Fang Li - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.13361)</summary>

**Abstract:** Medical coding converts free-text clinical notes into standardized diagnostic and procedural codes, which are essential for billing, hospital operations, and medical research. Unlike ordinary text classification, it requires multi-step reasoning: extracting diagnostic concepts, applying guideline constraints, mapping to hierarchical codebooks, and ensuring cross-document consistency. Recent advances leverage agentic LLMs, but most rely on rigid, manually crafted workflows that fail to capture the nuance and variability of real-world documentation, leaving open the question of how to systematically learn effective workflows. We present MedDCR, a closed-loop framework that treats workflow design as a learning problem. A Designer proposes workflows, a Coder executes them, and a Reflector evaluates predictions and provides constructive feedback, while a memory archive preserves prior designs for reuse and iterative refinement. On benchmark datasets, MedDCR outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and produces interpretable, adaptable workflows that better reflect real coding practice, improving both the reliability and trustworthiness of automated systems.

<summary><strong>An Operational Kardashev-Style Scale for Autonomous AI - Towards AGI and Superintelligence</strong> - Przemyslaw Chojecki - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.13411)</summary>

**Abstract:** We propose a Kardashev-inspired yet operational Autonomous AI (AAI) Scale that measures the progression from fixed robotic process automation (AAI-0) to full artificial general intelligence (AAI-4) and beyond. Unlike narrative ladders, our scale is multi-axis and testable. We define ten capability axes (Autonomy, Generality, Planning, Memory/Persistence, Tool Economy, Self-Revision, Sociality/Coordination, Embodiment, World-Model Fidelity, Economic Throughput) aggregated by a composite AAI-Index (a weighted geometric mean). We introduce a measurable Self-Improvement Coefficient $\kappa$ (capability growth per unit of agent-initiated resources) and two closure properties (maintenance and expansion) that convert ``self-improving AI'' into falsifiable criteria. We specify OWA-Bench, an open-world agency benchmark suite that evaluates long-horizon, tool-using, persistent agents. We define level gates for AAI-0\ldots AAI-4 using thresholds on the axes, $\kappa$, and closure proofs. Synthetic experiments illustrate how present-day systems map onto the scale and how the delegability frontier (quality vs.\ autonomy) advances with self-improvement. We also prove a theorem that AAI-3 agent becomes AAI-5 over time with sufficient conditions, formalizing "baby AGI" becomes Superintelligence intuition.

<summary><strong>Mixture-of-Schedulers: An Adaptive Scheduling Agent as a Learned Router for Expert Policies</strong> - Xinbo Wang, Shian Jia, Ziyang Huang, Jing Cao, Mingli Song - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.11628)</summary>

**Abstract:** Modern operating system schedulers employ a single, static policy, which struggles to deliver optimal performance across the diverse and dynamic workloads of contemporary systems. This "one-policy-fits-all" approach leads to significant compromises in fairness, throughput, and latency, particularly with the rise of heterogeneous hardware and varied application architectures.
This paper proposes a new paradigm: dynamically selecting the optimal policy from a portfolio of specialized schedulers rather than designing a single, monolithic one. We present the Adaptive Scheduling Agent (ASA), a lightweight framework that intelligently matches workloads to the most suitable "expert" scheduling policy at runtime. ASA's core is a novel, low-overhead offline/online approach. First, an offline process trains a universal, hardware-agnostic machine learning model to recognize abstract workload patterns from system behaviors. Second, at runtime, ASA continually processes the model's predictions using a time-weighted probability voting algorithm to identify the workload, then makes a scheduling decision by consulting a pre-configured, machine-specific mapping table to switch to the optimal scheduler via Linux's sched_ext framework. This decoupled architecture allows ASA to adapt to new hardware platforms rapidly without expensive retraining of the core recognition model.
Our evaluation, based on a novel benchmark focused on user-experience metrics, demonstrates that ASA consistently outperforms the default Linux scheduler (EEVDF), achieving superior results in 86.4% of test scenarios. Furthermore, ASA's selections are near-optimal, ranking among the top three schedulers in 78.6% of all scenarios. This validates our approach as a practical path toward more intelligent, adaptive, and responsive operating system schedulers.

<summary><strong>GCAgent: Long-Video Understanding via Schematic and Narrative Episodic Memory</strong> - Jeong Hun Yeo, Sangyun Chung, Sungjune Park, Dae Hoe Kim, Jinyoung Moon, Yong Man Ro - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.12027)</summary>

**Abstract:** Long-video understanding remains a significant challenge for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) due to inherent token limitations and the complexity of capturing long-term temporal dependencies. Existing methods often fail to capture the global context and complex event relationships necessary for deep video reasoning. To address this, we introduce GCAgent, a novel Global-Context-Aware Agent framework that achieves comprehensive long-video understanding. Our core innovation is the Schematic and Narrative Episodic Memory. This memory structurally models events and their causal and temporal relations into a concise, organized context, fundamentally resolving the long-term dependency problem. Operating in a multi-stage Perception-Action-Reflection cycle, our GCAgent utilizes a Memory Manager to retrieve relevant episodic context for robust, context-aware inference. Extensive experiments confirm that GCAgent significantly enhances long-video understanding, achieving up to 23.5\% accuracy improvement on the Video-MME Long split over a strong MLLM baseline. Furthermore, our framework establishes state-of-the-art performance among comparable 7B-scale MLLMs, achieving 73.4\% accuracy on the Long split and the highest overall average (71.9\%) on the Video-MME benchmark, validating our agent-based reasoning paradigm and structured memory for cognitively-inspired long-video understanding.

<summary><strong>MMWOZ: Building Multimodal Agent for Task-oriented Dialogue</strong> - Pu-Hai Yang, Heyan Huang, Heng-Da Xu, Fanshu Sun, Xian-Ling Mao, Chaoxu Mu - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.12586)</summary>

**Abstract:** Task-oriented dialogue systems have garnered significant attention due to their conversational ability to accomplish goals, such as booking airline tickets for users. Traditionally, task-oriented dialogue systems are conceptualized as intelligent agents that interact with users using natural language and have access to customized back-end APIs. However, in real-world scenarios, the widespread presence of front-end Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) and the absence of customized back-end APIs create a significant gap for traditional task-oriented dialogue systems in practical applications. In this paper, to bridge the gap, we collect MMWOZ, a new multimodal dialogue dataset that is extended from MultiWOZ 2.3 dataset. Specifically, we begin by developing a web-style GUI to serve as the front-end. Next, we devise an automated script to convert the dialogue states and system actions from the original dataset into operation instructions for the GUI. Lastly, we collect snapshots of the web pages along with their corresponding operation instructions. In addition, we propose a novel multimodal model called MATE (Multimodal Agent for Task-oriEnted dialogue) as the baseline model for the MMWOZ dataset. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive experimental analysis using MATE to investigate the construction of a practical multimodal agent for task-oriented dialogue.

<summary><strong>Mem-PAL: Towards Memory-based Personalized Dialogue Assistants for Long-term User-Agent Interaction</strong> - Zhaopei Huang, Qifeng Dai, Guozheng Wu, Xiaopeng Wu, Kehan Chen, Chuan Yu, Xubin Li, Tiezheng Ge, Wenxuan Wang, Qin Jin - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.13410)</summary>

**Abstract:** With the rise of smart personal devices, service-oriented human-agent interactions have become increasingly prevalent. This trend highlights the need for personalized dialogue assistants that can understand user-specific traits to accurately interpret requirements and tailor responses to individual preferences. However, existing approaches often overlook the complexities of long-term interactions and fail to capture users' subjective characteristics. To address these gaps, we present PAL-Bench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate the personalization capabilities of service-oriented assistants in long-term user-agent interactions. In the absence of available real-world data, we develop a multi-step LLM-based synthesis pipeline, which is further verified and refined by human annotators. This process yields PAL-Set, the first Chinese dataset comprising multi-session user logs and dialogue histories, which serves as the foundation for PAL-Bench. Furthermore, to improve personalized service-oriented interactions, we propose H$^2$Memory, a hierarchical and heterogeneous memory framework that incorporates retrieval-augmented generation to improve personalized response generation. Comprehensive experiments on both our PAL-Bench and an external dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed memory framework.

<summary><strong>T^2Agent A Tool-augmented Multimodal Misinformation Detection Agent with Monte Carlo Tree Search</strong> - Xing Cui, Yueying Zou, Zekun Li, Peipei Li, Xinyuan Xu, Xuannan Liu, Huaibo Huang - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.19768)</summary>

**Abstract:** Real-world multimodal misinformation often arises from mixed forgery sources, requiring dynamic reasoning and adaptive verification. However, existing methods mainly rely on static pipelines and limited tool usage, limiting their ability to handle such complexity and diversity. To address this challenge, we propose \method, a novel misinformation detection agent that incorporates an extensible toolkit with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). The toolkit consists of modular tools such as web search, forgery detection, and consistency analysis. Each tool is described using standardized templates, enabling seamless integration and future expansion. To avoid inefficiency from using all tools simultaneously, a greedy search-based selector is proposed to identify a task-relevant subset. This subset then serves as the action space for MCTS to dynamically collect evidence and perform multi-source verification. To better align MCTS with the multi-source nature of misinformation detection, \method~ extends traditional MCTS with multi-source verification, which decomposes the task into coordinated subtasks targeting different forgery sources. A dual reward mechanism containing a reasoning trajectory score and a confidence score is further proposed to encourage a balance between exploration across mixed forgery sources and exploitation for more reliable evidence. We conduct ablation studies to confirm the effectiveness of the tree search mechanism and tool usage. Extensive experiments further show that \method~ consistently outperforms existing baselines on challenging mixed-source multimodal misinformation benchmarks, demonstrating its strong potential as a training-free detector.

<summary><strong>Multimodal DeepResearcher: Generating Text-Chart Interleaved Reports From Scratch with Agentic Framework</strong> - Zhaorui Yang, Bo Pan, Han Wang, Yiyao Wang, Xingyu Liu, Luoxuan Weng, Yingchaojie Feng, Haozhe Feng, Minfeng Zhu, Bo Zhang, Wei Chen - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.02454)</summary>

**Abstract:** Visualizations play a crucial part in effective communication of concepts and information. Recent advances in reasoning and retrieval augmented generation have enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform deep research and generate comprehensive reports. Despite its progress, existing deep research frameworks primarily focus on generating text-only content, leaving the automated generation of interleaved texts and visualizations underexplored. This novel task poses key challenges in designing informative visualizations and effectively integrating them with text reports. To address these challenges, we propose Formal Description of Visualization (FDV), a structured textual representation of charts that enables LLMs to learn from and generate diverse, high-quality visualizations. Building on this representation, we introduce Multimodal DeepResearcher, an agentic framework that decomposes the task into four stages: (1) researching, (2) exemplar report textualization, (3) planning, and (4) multimodal report generation. For the evaluation of generated multimodal reports, we develop MultimodalReportBench, which contains 100 diverse topics served as inputs along with 5 dedicated metrics. Extensive experiments across models and evaluation methods demonstrate the effectiveness of Multimodal DeepResearcher. Notably, utilizing the same Claude 3.7 Sonnet model, Multimodal DeepResearcher achieves an 82\% overall win rate over the baseline method.

<summary><strong>SWE-Bench Pro: Can AI Agents Solve Long-Horizon Software Engineering Tasks?</strong> - Xiang Deng, Jeff Da, Edwin Pan, Yannis Yiming He, Charles Ide, Kanak Garg, Niklas Lauffer, Andrew Park, Nitin Pasari, Chetan Rane, Karmini Sampath, Maya Krishnan, Srivatsa Kundurthy, Sean Hendryx, Zifan Wang, Vijay Bharadwaj, Jeff Holm, Raja Aluri, Chen Bo Calvin Zhang, Noah Jacobson, Bing Liu, Brad Kenstler - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.16941)</summary>

**Abstract:** We introduce SWE-Bench Pro, a substantially more challenging benchmark that builds upon the best practices of SWE-BENCH [25], but is explicitly designed to capture realistic, complex, enterprise-level problems beyond the scope of SWE-BENCH. SWE-BENCH PRO contains 1,865 problems sourced from a diverse set of 41 actively maintained repositories spanning business applications, B2B services, and developer tools. The benchmark is partitioned into a public set with open access to problems sourced from 11 repositories, a held-out set of 12 repositories and a commercial set of 18 proprietary repositories where we have formal partnership agreements with early-stage startups. Problems in the held-out and the commercial set are not publicly accessible, but we release results on the commercial set. Our benchmark features long-horizon tasks that may require hours to days for a professional software engineer to complete, often involving patches across multiple files and substantial code modifications. All tasks are human-verified and augmented with sufficient context to ensure resolvability. To better understand these limitations, we cluster the failure modes observed in the collected agent trajectories for a clearer characterization of the error patterns exhibited by current models. Overall, SWE-BENCH PRO provides a contamination-resistant testbed that more faithfully captures the complexity and diversity of real-world software development, advancing the pursuit of truly autonomous software engineering agents at a professional level.

<summary><strong>EcoFlight: Finding Low-Energy Paths Through Obstacles for Autonomous Sensing Drones</strong> - Jordan Leyva, Nahim J. Moran Vera, Yihan Xu, Adrien Durasno, Christopher U. Romero, Tendai Chimuka, Gabriel O. Huezo Ramirez, Ziqian Dong, Roberto Rojas-Cessa - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.12618)</summary>

**Abstract:** Obstacle avoidance path planning for uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs), or drones, is rarely addressed in most flight path planning schemes, despite obstacles being a realistic condition. Obstacle avoidance can also be energy-intensive, making it a critical factor in efficient point-to-point drone flights. To address these gaps, we propose EcoFlight, an energy-efficient pathfinding algorithm that determines the lowest-energy route in 3D space with obstacles. The algorithm models energy consumption based on the drone propulsion system and flight dynamics. We conduct extensive evaluations, comparing EcoFlight with direct-flight and shortest-distance schemes. The simulation results across various obstacle densities show that EcoFlight consistently finds paths with lower energy consumption than comparable algorithms, particularly in high-density environments. We also demonstrate that a suitable flying speed can further enhance energy savings.

<summary><strong>Towards High-Consistency Embodied World Model with Multi-View Trajectory Videos</strong> - Taiyi Su, Jian Zhu, Yaxuan Li, Chong Ma, Zitai Huang, Yichen Zhu, Hanli Wang, Yi Xu - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.12882)</summary>

**Abstract:** Embodied world models aim to predict and interact with the physical world through visual observations and actions. However, existing models struggle to accurately translate low-level actions (e.g., joint positions) into precise robotic movements in predicted frames, leading to inconsistencies with real-world physical interactions. To address these limitations, we propose MTV-World, an embodied world model that introduces Multi-view Trajectory-Video control for precise visuomotor prediction. Specifically, instead of directly using low-level actions for control, we employ trajectory videos obtained through camera intrinsic and extrinsic parameters and Cartesian-space transformation as control signals. However, projecting 3D raw actions onto 2D images inevitably causes a loss of spatial information, making a single view insufficient for accurate interaction modeling. To overcome this, we introduce a multi-view framework that compensates for spatial information loss and ensures high-consistency with physical world. MTV-World forecasts future frames based on multi-view trajectory videos as input and conditioning on an initial frame per view. Furthermore, to systematically evaluate both robotic motion precision and object interaction accuracy, we develop an auto-evaluation pipeline leveraging multimodal large models and referring video object segmentation models. To measure spatial consistency, we formulate it as an object location matching problem and adopt the Jaccard Index as the evaluation metric. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MTV-World achieves precise control execution and accurate physical interaction modeling in complex dual-arm scenarios.

<summary><strong>GUIDE: Gaussian Unified Instance Detection for Enhanced Obstacle Perception in Autonomous Driving</strong> - Chunyong Hu, Qi Luo, Jianyun Xu, Song Wang, Qiang Li, Sheng Yang - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.12941)</summary>

**Abstract:** In the realm of autonomous driving, accurately detecting surrounding obstacles is crucial for effective decision-making. Traditional methods primarily rely on 3D bounding boxes to represent these obstacles, which often fail to capture the complexity of irregularly shaped, real-world objects. To overcome these limitations, we present GUIDE, a novel framework that utilizes 3D Gaussians for instance detection and occupancy prediction. Unlike conventional occupancy prediction methods, GUIDE also offers robust tracking capabilities. Our framework employs a sparse representation strategy, using Gaussian-to-Voxel Splatting to provide fine-grained, instance-level occupancy data without the computational demands associated with dense voxel grids. Experimental validation on the nuScenes dataset demonstrates GUIDE's performance, with an instance occupancy mAP of 21.61, marking a 50\% improvement over existing methods, alongside competitive tracking capabilities. GUIDE establishes a new benchmark in autonomous perception systems, effectively combining precision with computational efficiency to better address the complexities of real-world driving environments.

<summary><strong>EnerVerse: Envisioning Embodied Future Space for Robotics Manipulation</strong> - Siyuan Huang, Liliang Chen, Pengfei Zhou, Shengcong Chen, Zhengkai Jiang, Yue Hu, Yue Liao, Peng Gao, Hongsheng Li, Maoqing Yao, Guanghui Ren - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.01895)</summary>

**Abstract:** We introduce EnerVerse, a generative robotics foundation model that constructs and interprets embodied spaces. EnerVerse employs a chunk-wise autoregressive video diffusion framework to predict future embodied spaces from instructions, enhanced by a sparse context memory for long-term reasoning. To model the 3D robotics world, we adopt a multi-view video representation, providing rich perspectives to address challenges like motion ambiguity and 3D grounding. Additionally, EnerVerse-D, a data engine pipeline combining generative modeling with 4D Gaussian Splatting, forms a self-reinforcing data loop to reduce the sim-to-real gap. Leveraging these innovations, EnerVerse translates 4D world representations into physical actions via a policy head (EnerVerse-A), achieving state-of-the-art performance in both simulation and real-world tasks. For efficiency, EnerVerse-A reuses features from the first denoising step and predicts action chunks, achieving about 280 ms per 8-step action chunk on a single RTX 4090. Further video demos, dataset samples could be found in our project page.

<summary><strong>Dynamic Risk Assessment for Autonomous Vehicles from Spatio-Temporal Probabilistic Occupancy Heatmaps</strong> - Han Wang, Yuneil Yeo, Antonio R. Paiva, Jean Utke, Maria Laura Delle Monache - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.16480)</summary>

**Abstract:** Accurately assessing collision risk in dynamic traffic scenarios is a crucial requirement for trajectory planning in autonomous vehicles~(AVs) and enables a comprehensive safety evaluation of automated driving systems. To that end, this paper presents a novel probabilistic occupancy risk assessment~(PORA) metric. It uses spatiotemporal heatmaps as probabilistic occupancy predictions of surrounding traffic participants and estimates the risk of a collision along an AV's planned trajectory based on potential vehicle interactions. The use of probabilistic occupancy allows PORA to account for the uncertainty in future trajectories and velocities of traffic participants in the risk estimates. The risk from potential vehicle interactions is then further adjusted through a Cox model\edit{,} which considers the relative \edit{motion} between the AV and surrounding traffic participants. We demonstrate that the proposed approach enhances the accuracy of collision risk assessment in dynamic traffic scenarios, resulting in safer vehicle controllers, and provides a robust framework for real-time decision-making in autonomous driving systems. From evaluation in Monte Carlo simulations, PORA is shown to be more effective at accurately characterizing collision risk compared to other safety surrogate measures. Keywords: Dynamic Risk Assessment, Autonomous Vehicle, Probabilistic Occupancy, Driving Safety

<summary><strong>Towards autonomous quantum physics research using LLM agents with access to intelligent tools</strong> - Sören Arlt, Xuemei Gu, Mario Krenn - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.11752)</summary>

**Abstract:** Artificial intelligence (AI) is used in numerous fields of science, yet the initial research questions and targets are still almost always provided by human researchers. AI-generated creative ideas in science are rare and often vague, so that it remains a human task to execute them. Automating idea generation and implementation in one coherent system would significantly shift the role of humans in the scientific process. Here we present AI-Mandel, an LLM agent that can generate and implement ideas in quantum physics. AI-Mandel formulates ideas from the literature and uses a domain-specific AI tool to turn them into concrete experiment designs that can readily be implemented in laboratories. The generated ideas by AI-Mandel are often scientifically interesting - for two of them we have already written independent scientific follow-up papers. The ideas include new variations of quantum teleportation, primitives of quantum networks in indefinite causal orders, and new concepts of geometric phases based on closed loops of quantum information transfer. AI-Mandel is a prototypical demonstration of an AI physicist that can generate and implement concrete, actionable ideas. Building such a system is not only useful to accelerate science, but it also reveals concrete open challenges on the path to human-level artificial scientists.

<summary><strong>MoralReason: Generalizable Moral Decision Alignment For LLM Agents Using Reasoning-Level Reinforcement Learning</strong> - Zhiyu An, Wan Du - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.12271)</summary>

**Abstract:** Large language models are increasingly influencing human moral decisions, yet current approaches focus primarily on evaluating rather than actively steering their moral decisions. We formulate this as an out-of-distribution moral alignment problem, where LLM agents must learn to apply consistent moral reasoning frameworks to scenarios beyond their training distribution. We introduce Moral-Reason-QA, a novel dataset extending 680 human-annotated, high-ambiguity moral scenarios with framework-specific reasoning traces across utilitarian, deontological, and virtue ethics, enabling systematic evaluation of moral generalization in realistic decision contexts. Our learning approach employs Group Relative Policy Optimization with composite rewards that simultaneously optimize decision alignment and framework-specific reasoning processes to facilitate learning of the underlying moral frameworks. Experimental results demonstrate successful generalization to unseen moral scenarios, with softmax-normalized alignment scores improving by +0.757 for utilitarian and +0.450 for deontological frameworks when tested on out-of-distribution evaluation sets. The experiments also reveal training challenges and promising directions that inform future research. These findings establish that LLM agents can be systematically trained to internalize and apply specific moral frameworks to novel situations, providing a critical foundation for AI safety as language models become more integrated into human decision-making processes.

<summary><strong>Conformal Constrained Policy Optimization for Cost-Effective LLM Agents</strong> - Wenwen Si, Sooyong Jang, Insup Lee, Osbert Bastani - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.11828)</summary>

**Abstract:** While large language models (LLMs) have recently made tremendous progress towards solving challenging AI problems, they have done so at increasingly steep computational and API costs. We propose a novel strategy where we combine multiple LLM models with varying cost/accuracy tradeoffs in an agentic manner, where models and tools are run in sequence as determined by an orchestration model to minimize cost subject to a user-specified level of reliability; this constraint is formalized using conformal prediction to provide guarantees. To solve this problem, we propose Conformal Constrained Policy Optimization (CCPO), a training paradigm that integrates constrained policy optimization with off-policy reinforcement learning and recent advances in online conformal prediction. CCPO jointly optimizes a cost-aware policy (score function) and an adaptive threshold. Across two multi-hop question answering benchmarks, CCPO achieves up to a 30% cost reduction compared to other cost-aware baselines and LLM-guided methods without compromising reliability. Our approach provides a principled and practical framework for deploying LLM agents that are significantly more cost-effective while maintaining reliability.

<summary><strong>Live-SWE-agent: Can Software Engineering Agents Self-Evolve on the Fly?</strong> - Chunqiu Steven Xia, Zhe Wang, Yan Yang, Yuxiang Wei, Lingming Zhang - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.13646)</summary>

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) are reshaping almost all industries, including software engineering. In recent years, a number of LLM agents have been proposed to solve real-world software problems. Such software agents are typically equipped with a suite of coding tools and can autonomously decide the next actions to form complete trajectories to solve end-to-end software tasks. While promising, they typically require dedicated design and may still be suboptimal, since it can be extremely challenging and costly to exhaust the entire agent scaffold design space. Recognizing that software agents are inherently software themselves that can be further refined/modified, researchers have proposed a number of self-improving software agents recently, including the Darwin-Gödel Machine (DGM). Meanwhile, such self-improving agents require costly offline training on specific benchmarks and may not generalize well across different LLMs or benchmarks. In this paper, we propose Live-SWE-agent, the first live software agent that can autonomously and continuously evolve itself on-the-fly during runtime when solving real-world software problems. More specifically, Live-SWE-agent starts with the most basic agent scaffold with only access to bash tools (e.g., mini-SWE-agent), and autonomously evolves its own scaffold implementation while solving real-world software problems. Our evaluation on the widely studied SWE-bench Verified benchmark shows that Live-SWE-agent can achieve an impressive solve rate of 75.4% without test-time scaling, outperforming all existing open-source software agents and approaching the performance of the best proprietary solution. Moreover, Live-SWE-agent outperforms state-of-the-art manually crafted software agents on the recent SWE-Bench Pro benchmark, achieving the best-known solve rate of 45.8%.

<summary><strong>Unintended Misalignment from Agentic Fine-Tuning: Risks and Mitigation</strong> - Dongyoon Hahm, Taywon Min, Woogyeol Jin, Kimin Lee - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.14031)</summary>

**Abstract:** Beyond simple text generation, Large Language Models (LLMs) have evolved into agentic systems capable of planning and interacting with external tools to solve complex tasks. This evolution involves fine-tuning LLMs on agent-specific tasks to enhance their proficiency. However, safety concerns are frequently overlooked during this fine-tuning process. In this work, we show that aligned LLMs can become unintentionally misaligned, leading to a higher likelihood of executing harmful tasks and a reduced tendency to refuse them when fine-tuned to execute agentic tasks. To address these safety challenges, we propose Prefix INjection Guard (PING), a simple yet effective method that prepends automatically generated natural language prefixes to agent responses, guiding them to refuse harmful requests while preserving performance on benign tasks. Specifically, we introduce an iterative approach that alternates between (1) generating candidate prefixes and (2) selecting those that optimize both task performance and refusal behavior. Experimental results demonstrate that PING significantly enhances the safety of fine-tuned LLM agents without sacrificing their effectiveness. PING consistently outperforms existing prompting approaches across diverse benchmarks in both web navigation and code generation tasks. Our analysis of internal hidden states via linear probes reveals that prefix tokens are crucial for behavior modification, explaining the performance gains.

**Abstract:** Autonomous machine learning research has gained significant attention recently. We present MLR-COPILOT, an autonomous Machine Learning Research framework powered by large language model agents. The system is designed to enhance ML research productivity through automatic generation and implementation of research ideas within constraints. Our work was released in August 2024 (concurrent to AI-Scientist) and has gained notable recognition from leading projects. We further enhance our ideation with training afterwards. The framework consists of three stages: idea generation, experiment implementation, and code execution. First, existing research papers are used to generate feasible ideas and experiment plans with IdeaAgent, powered by an RL-tuned LLM. Next, ExperimentAgent leverages retrieved prototype code to convert plans into executable code with optionally retrieved candidate models and data from HuggingFace. In the final stage, ExperimentAgent runs experiments, and allows subsequent iterations of debugging and human feedback for a better chance of success with executable outcomes. We evaluate our framework on five machine learning research tasks. Experiment results demonstrate the potential of our framework to facilitate ML research progress and innovation.

**Abstract:** Cancer patients often lack timely education and personalized support due to clinician workload. This quality improvement study develops and evaluates a Large Language Model (LLM) agent, MedEduChat, which is integrated with the clinic's electronic health records (EHR) and designed to enhance prostate cancer patient education. Fifteen non-metastatic prostate cancer patients and three clinicians recruited from the Mayo Clinic interacted with the agent between May 2024 and April 2025. Findings showed that MedEduChat has a high usability score (UMUX 83.7 out of 100) and improves patients' health confidence (Health Confidence Score rose from 9.9 to 13.9). Clinicians evaluated the patient-chat interaction history and rated MedEduChat as highly correct (2.9 out of 3), complete (2.7 out of 3), and safe (2.7 out of 3), with moderate personalization (2.3 out of 3). This study highlights the potential of LLM agents to improve patient engagement and health education.

<summary><strong>Debate over Mixed-knowledge: A Robust Multi-Agent Framework for Incomplete Knowledge Graph Question Answering</strong> - Jilong Liu, Pengyang Shao, Wei Qin, Fei Liu, Yonghui Yang, Richang Hong - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.12208)</summary>

**Abstract:** Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) aims to improve factual accuracy by leveraging structured knowledge. However, real-world Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are often incomplete, leading to the problem of Incomplete KGQA (IKGQA). A common solution is to incorporate external data to fill knowledge gaps, but existing methods lack the capacity to adaptively and contextually fuse multiple sources, failing to fully exploit their complementary strengths. To this end, we propose Debate over Mixed-knowledge (DoM), a novel framework that enables dynamic integration of structured and unstructured knowledge for IKGQA. Built upon the Multi-Agent Debate paradigm, DoM assigns specialized agents to perform inference over knowledge graphs and external texts separately, and coordinates their outputs through iterative interaction. It decomposes the input question into sub-questions, retrieves evidence via dual agents (KG and Retrieval-Augmented Generation, RAG), and employs a judge agent to evaluate and aggregate intermediate answers. This collaboration exploits knowledge complementarity and enhances robustness to KG incompleteness. In addition, existing IKGQA datasets simulate incompleteness by randomly removing triples, failing to capture the irregular and unpredictable nature of real-world knowledge incompleteness. To address this, we introduce a new dataset, Incomplete Knowledge Graph WebQuestions, constructed by leveraging real-world knowledge updates. These updates reflect knowledge beyond the static scope of KGs, yielding a more realistic and challenging benchmark. Through extensive experiments, we show that DoM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

<summary><strong>Mobile-Agent-RAG: Driving Smart Multi-Agent Coordination with Contextual Knowledge Empowerment for Long-Horizon Mobile Automation</strong> - Yuxiang Zhou, Jichang Li, Yanhao Zhang, Haonan Lu, Guanbin Li - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.12254)</summary>

**Abstract:** Mobile agents show immense potential, yet current state-of-the-art (SoTA) agents exhibit inadequate success rates on real-world, long-horizon, cross-application tasks. We attribute this bottleneck to the agents' excessive reliance on static, internal knowledge within MLLMs, which leads to two critical failure points: 1) strategic hallucinations in high-level planning and 2) operational errors during low-level execution on user interfaces (UI). The core insight of this paper is that high-level planning and low-level UI operations require fundamentally distinct types of knowledge. Planning demands high-level, strategy-oriented experiences, whereas operations necessitate low-level, precise instructions closely tied to specific app UIs. Motivated by these insights, we propose Mobile-Agent-RAG, a novel hierarchical multi-agent framework that innovatively integrates dual-level retrieval augmentation. At the planning stage, we introduce Manager-RAG to reduce strategic hallucinations by retrieving human-validated comprehensive task plans that provide high-level guidance. At the execution stage, we develop Operator-RAG to improve execution accuracy by retrieving the most precise low-level guidance for accurate atomic actions, aligned with the current app and subtask. To accurately deliver these knowledge types, we construct two specialized retrieval-oriented knowledge bases. Furthermore, we introduce Mobile-Eval-RAG, a challenging benchmark for evaluating such agents on realistic multi-app, long-horizon tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mobile-Agent-RAG significantly outperforms SoTA baselines, improving task completion rate by 11.0% and step efficiency by 10.2%, establishing a robust paradigm for context-aware, reliable multi-agent mobile automation.

**Abstract:** Online health resources and large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as a first point of contact for medical decision-making, yet their reliability in healthcare remains limited by low accuracy, lack of transparency, and susceptibility to unverified information. We introduce a proof-of-concept conversational self-triage system that guides LLMs with 100 clinically validated flowcharts from the American Medical Association, providing a structured and auditable framework for patient decision support. The system leverages a multi-agent framework consisting of a retrieval agent, a decision agent, and a chat agent to identify the most relevant flowchart, interpret patient responses, and deliver personalized, patient-friendly recommendations, respectively. Performance was evaluated at scale using synthetic datasets of simulated conversations. The system achieved 95.29% top-3 accuracy in flowchart retrieval (N=2,000) and 99.10% accuracy in flowchart navigation across varied conversational styles and conditions (N=37,200). By combining the flexibility of free-text interaction with the rigor of standardized clinical protocols, this approach demonstrates the feasibility of transparent, accurate, and generalizable AI-assisted self-triage, with potential to support informed patient decision-making while improving healthcare resource utilization.

<summary><strong>Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Heterogeneous Satellite Cluster Resources Optimization</strong> - Mohamad A. Hady, Siyi Hu, Mahardhika Pratama, Zehong Cao, Ryszard Kowalczyk - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.12792)</summary>

**Abstract:** This work investigates resource optimization in heterogeneous satellite clusters performing autonomous Earth Observation (EO) missions using Reinforcement Learning (RL). In the proposed setting, two optical satellites and one Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite operate cooperatively in low Earth orbit to capture ground targets and manage their limited onboard resources efficiently. Traditional optimization methods struggle to handle the real-time, uncertain, and decentralized nature of EO operations, motivating the use of RL and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) for adaptive decision-making. This study systematically formulates the optimization problem from single-satellite to multi-satellite scenarios, addressing key challenges including energy and memory constraints, partial observability, and agent heterogeneity arising from diverse payload capabilities. Using a near-realistic simulation environment built on the Basilisk and BSK-RL frameworks, we evaluate the performance and stability of state-of-the-art MARL algorithms such as MAPPO, HAPPO, and HATRPO. Results show that MARL enables effective coordination across heterogeneous satellites, balancing imaging performance and resource utilization while mitigating non-stationarity and inter-agent reward coupling. The findings provide practical insights into scalable, autonomous satellite operations and contribute a foundation for future research on intelligent EO mission planning under heterogeneous and dynamic conditions.

<summary><strong>Think, Speak, Decide: Language-Augmented Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Economic Decision-Making</strong> - Heyang Ma, Qirui Mi, Qipeng Yang, Zijun Fan, Bo Li, Haifeng Zhang - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.12876)</summary>

**Abstract:** Economic decision-making depends not only on structured signals such as prices and taxes, but also on unstructured language, including peer dialogue and media narratives. While multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has shown promise in optimizing economic decisions, it struggles with the semantic ambiguity and contextual richness of language. We propose LAMP (Language-Augmented Multi-Agent Policy), a framework that integrates language into economic decision-making and narrows the gap to real-world settings. LAMP follows a Think-Speak-Decide pipeline: (1) Think interprets numerical observations to extract short-term shocks and long-term trends, caching high-value reasoning trajectories; (2) Speak crafts and exchanges strategic messages based on reasoning, updating beliefs by parsing peer communications; and (3) Decide fuses numerical data, reasoning, and reflections into a MARL policy to optimize language-augmented decision-making. Experiments in economic simulation show that LAMP outperforms both MARL and LLM-only baselines in cumulative return (+63.5%, +34.0%), robustness (+18.8%, +59.4%), and interpretability. These results demonstrate the potential of language-augmented policies to deliver more effective and robust economic strategies.

**Abstract:** Power grid fault diagnosis is a critical process hindered by its reliance on manual, error-prone methods. Technicians must manually extract reasoning logic from dense regulations and attempt to combine it with tacit expert knowledge, which is inefficient, error-prone, and lacks maintainability as ragulations are updated and experience evolves. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in parsing unstructured text, no existing framework integrates these two disparate knowledge sources into a single, verified, and executable workflow. To bridge this gap, we propose Fault2Flow, an LLM-based multi-agent system. Fault2Flow systematically: (1) extracts and structures regulatory logic into PASTA-formatted fault trees; (2) integrates expert knowledge via a human-in-the-loop interface for verification; (3) optimizes the reasoning logic using a novel AlphaEvolve module; and (4) synthesizes the final, verified logic into an n8n-executable workflow. Experimental validation on transformer fault diagnosis datasets confirms 100\% topological consistency and high semantic fidelity. Fault2Flow establishes a reproducible path from fault analysis to operational automation, substantially reducing expert workload.

<summary><strong>Conditional Diffusion Model for Multi-Agent Dynamic Task Decomposition</strong> - Yanda Zhu, Yuanyang Zhu, Daoyi Dong, Caihua Chen, Chunlin Chen - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.13137)</summary>

**Abstract:** Task decomposition has shown promise in complex cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) tasks, which enables efficient hierarchical learning for long-horizon tasks in dynamic and uncertain environments. However, learning dynamic task decomposition from scratch generally requires a large number of training samples, especially exploring the large joint action space under partial observability. In this paper, we present the Conditional Diffusion Model for Dynamic Task Decomposition (C$\text{D}^\text{3}$T), a novel two-level hierarchical MARL framework designed to automatically infer subtask and coordination patterns. The high-level policy learns subtask representation to generate a subtask selection strategy based on subtask effects. To capture the effects of subtasks on the environment, C$\text{D}^\text{3}$T predicts the next observation and reward using a conditional diffusion model. At the low level, agents collaboratively learn and share specialized skills within their assigned subtasks. Moreover, the learned subtask representation is also used as additional semantic information in a multi-head attention mixing network to enhance value decomposition and provide an efficient reasoning bridge between individual and joint value functions. Experimental results on various benchmarks demonstrate that C$\text{D}^\text{3}$T achieves better performance than existing baselines.

<summary><strong>Cost-Effective Communication: An Auction-based Method for Language Agent Interaction</strong> - Yijia Fan, Jusheng Zhang, Kaitong Cai, Jing Yang, Chengpei Tang, Jian Wang, Keze Wang - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.13193)</summary>

**Abstract:** Multi-agent systems (MAS) built on large language models (LLMs) often suffer from inefficient "free-for-all" communication, leading to exponential token costs and low signal-to-noise ratios that hinder their practical deployment. We challenge the notion that more communication is always beneficial, hypothesizing instead that the core issue is the absence of resource rationality. We argue that "free" communication, by ignoring the principle of scarcity, inherently breeds inefficiency and unnecessary expenses. To address this, we introduce the Dynamic Auction-based Language Agent (DALA), a novel framework that treats communication bandwidth as a scarce and tradable resource. Specifically, our DALA regards inter-agent communication as a centralized auction, where agents learn to bid for the opportunity to speak based on the predicted value density of their messages. Thus, our DALA intrinsically encourages agents to produce concise, informative messages while filtering out low-value communication. Extensive and comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our economically-driven DALA achieves new state-of-the-art performance across seven challenging reasoning benchmarks, including 84.32% on MMLU and a 91.21% pass@1 rate on HumanEval. Note that this is accomplished with remarkable efficiency, i.e., our DALA uses only 6.25 million tokens, a fraction of the resources consumed by current state-of-the-art methods on GSM8K. Further analysis reveals that our DALA cultivates the emergent skill of strategic silence, effectively adapting its communication strategies from verbosity to silence in a dynamical manner via resource constraints.

<summary><strong>Multi-Agent Deep Research: Training Multi-Agent Systems with M-GRPO</strong> - Haoyang Hong, Jiajun Yin, Yuan Wang, Jingnan Liu, Zhe Chen, Ailing Yu, Ji Li, Zhiling Ye, Hansong Xiao, Yefei Chen, Hualei Zhou, Yun Yue, Minghui Yang, Chunxiao Guo, Junwei Liu, Peng Wei, Jinjie Gu - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.13288)</summary>

**Abstract:** Multi-agent systems perform well on general reasoning tasks. However, the lack of training in specialized areas hinders their accuracy. Current training methods train a unified large language model (LLM) for all agents in the system. This may limit the performances due to different distributions underlying for different agents. Therefore, training multi-agent systems with distinct LLMs should be the next step to solve. However, this approach introduces optimization challenges. For example, agents operate at different frequencies, rollouts involve varying sub-agent invocations, and agents are often deployed across separate servers, disrupting end-to-end gradient flow. To address these issues, we propose M-GRPO, a hierarchical extension of Group Relative Policy Optimization designed for vertical Multi-agent systems with a main agent (planner) and multiple sub-agents (multi-turn tool executors). M-GRPO computes group-relative advantages for both main and sub-agents, maintaining hierarchical credit assignment. It also introduces a trajectory-alignment scheme that generates fixed-size batches despite variable sub-agent invocations. We deploy a decoupled training pipeline in which agents run on separate servers and exchange minimal statistics via a shared store. This enables scalable training without cross-server backpropagation. In experiments on real-world benchmarks (e.g., GAIA, XBench-DeepSearch, and WebWalkerQA), M-GRPO consistently outperforms both single-agent GRPO and multi-agent GRPO with frozen sub-agents, demonstrating improved stability and sample efficiency. These results show that aligning heterogeneous trajectories and decoupling optimization across specialized agents enhances tool-augmented reasoning tasks.

<summary><strong>Multi-Agent Multimodal Large Language Model Framework for Automated Interpretation of Fuel Efficiency Analytics in Public Transportation</strong> - Zhipeng Ma, Ali Rida Bahja, Andreas Burgdorf, André Pomp, Tobias Meisen, Bo Nørregaard Jørgensen, Zheng Grace Ma - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.13476)</summary>

**Abstract:** Enhancing fuel efficiency in public transportation requires the integration of complex multimodal data into interpretable, decision-relevant insights. However, traditional analytics and visualization methods often yield fragmented outputs that demand extensive human interpretation, limiting scalability and consistency. This study presents a multi-agent framework that leverages multimodal large language models (LLMs) to automate data narration and energy insight generation. The framework coordinates three specialized agents, including a data narration agent, an LLM-as-a-judge agent, and an optional human-in-the-loop evaluator, to iteratively transform analytical artifacts into coherent, stakeholder-oriented reports. The system is validated through a real-world case study on public bus transportation in Northern Jutland, Denmark, where fuel efficiency data from 4006 trips are analyzed using Gaussian Mixture Model clustering. Comparative experiments across five state-of-the-art LLMs and three prompting paradigms identify GPT-4.1 mini with Chain-of-Thought prompting as the optimal configuration, achieving 97.3% narrative accuracy while balancing interpretability and computational cost. The findings demonstrate that multi-agent orchestration significantly enhances factual precision, coherence, and scalability in LLM-based reporting. The proposed framework establishes a replicable and domain-adaptive methodology for AI-driven narrative generation and decision support in energy informatics.

<summary><strong>EduAgentQG: A Multi-Agent Workflow Framework for Personalized Question Generation</strong> - Rui Jia, Min Zhang, Fengrui Liu, Bo Jiang, Kun Kuang, Zhongxiang Dai - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.11635)</summary>

**Abstract:** High-quality personalized question banks are crucial for supporting adaptive learning and individualized assessment. Manually designing questions is time-consuming and often fails to meet diverse learning needs, making automated question generation a crucial approach to reduce teachers' workload and improve the scalability of educational resources. However, most existing question generation methods rely on single-agent or rule-based pipelines, which still produce questions with unstable quality, limited diversity, and insufficient alignment with educational goals. To address these challenges, we propose EduAgentQG, a multi-agent collaborative framework for generating high-quality and diverse personalized questions. The framework consists of five specialized agents and operates through an iterative feedback loop: the Planner generates structured design plans and multiple question directions to enhance diversity; the Writer produces candidate questions based on the plan and optimizes their quality and diversity using feedback from the Solver and Educator; the Solver and Educator perform binary scoring across multiple evaluation dimensions and feed the evaluation results back to the Writer; the Checker conducts final verification, including answer correctness and clarity, ensuring alignment with educational goals. Through this multi-agent collaboration and iterative feedback loop, EduAgentQG generates questions that are both high-quality and diverse, while maintaining consistency with educational objectives. Experiments on two mathematics question datasets demonstrate that EduAgentQG outperforms existing single-agent and multi-agent methods in terms of question diversity, goal consistency, and overall quality.

<summary><strong>Convergence of Multiagent Learning Systems for Traffic control</strong> - Sayambhu Sen, Shalabh Bhatnagar - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.11654)</summary>

**Abstract:** Rapid urbanization in cities like Bangalore has led to severe traffic congestion, making efficient Traffic Signal Control (TSC) essential. Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), often modeling each traffic signal as an independent agent using Q-learning, has emerged as a promising strategy to reduce average commuter delays. While prior work Prashant L A et. al has empirically demonstrated the effectiveness of this approach, a rigorous theoretical analysis of its stability and convergence properties in the context of traffic control has not been explored. This paper bridges that gap by focusing squarely on the theoretical basis of this multi-agent algorithm. We investigate the convergence problem inherent in using independent learners for the cooperative TSC task. Utilizing stochastic approximation methods, we formally analyze the learning dynamics. The primary contribution of this work is the proof that the specific multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm for traffic control is proven to converge under the given conditions extending it from single agent convergence proofs for asynchronous value iteration.

<summary><strong>Concept-RuleNet: Grounded Multi-Agent Neurosymbolic Reasoning in Vision Language Models</strong> - Sanchit Sinha, Guangzhi Xiong, Zhenghao He, Aidong Zhang - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.11751)</summary>

**Abstract:** Modern vision-language models (VLMs) deliver impressive predictive accuracy yet offer little insight into 'why' a decision is reached, frequently hallucinating facts, particularly when encountering out-of-distribution data. Neurosymbolic frameworks address this by pairing black-box perception with interpretable symbolic reasoning, but current methods extract their symbols solely from task labels, leaving them weakly grounded in the underlying visual data. In this paper, we introduce a multi-agent system - Concept-RuleNet that reinstates visual grounding while retaining transparent reasoning. Specifically, a multimodal concept generator first mines discriminative visual concepts directly from a representative subset of training images. Next, these visual concepts are utilized to condition symbol discovery, anchoring the generations in real image statistics and mitigating label bias. Subsequently, symbols are composed into executable first-order rules by a large language model reasoner agent - yielding interpretable neurosymbolic rules. Finally, during inference, a vision verifier agent quantifies the degree of presence of each symbol and triggers rule execution in tandem with outputs of black-box neural models, predictions with explicit reasoning pathways. Experiments on five benchmarks, including two challenging medical-imaging tasks and three underrepresented natural-image datasets, show that our system augments state-of-the-art neurosymbolic baselines by an average of 5% while also reducing the occurrence of hallucinated symbols in rules by up to 50%.

<summary><strong>Scaling Equitable Reflection Assessment in Education via Large Language Models and Role-Based Feedback Agents</strong> - Chenyu Zhang, Xiaohang Luo - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.11772)</summary>

**Abstract:** Formative feedback is widely recognized as one of the most effective drivers of student learning, yet it remains difficult to implement equitably at scale. In large or low-resource courses, instructors often lack the time, staffing, and bandwidth required to review and respond to every student reflection, creating gaps in support precisely where learners would benefit most. This paper presents a theory-grounded system that uses five coordinated role-based LLM agents (Evaluator, Equity Monitor, Metacognitive Coach, Aggregator, and Reflexion Reviewer) to score learner reflections with a shared rubric and to generate short, bias-aware, learner-facing comments. The agents first produce structured rubric scores, then check for potentially biased or exclusionary language, add metacognitive prompts that invite students to think about their own thinking, and finally compose a concise feedback message of at most 120 words. The system includes simple fairness checks that compare scoring error across lower and higher scoring learners, enabling instructors to monitor and bound disparities in accuracy. We evaluate the pipeline in a 12-session AI literacy program with adult learners. In this setting, the system produces rubric scores that approach expert-level agreement, and trained graders rate the AI-generated comments as helpful, empathetic, and well aligned with instructional goals. Taken together, these results show that multi-agent LLM systems can deliver equitable, high-quality formative feedback at a scale and speed that would be impossible for human graders alone. More broadly, the work points toward a future where feedback-rich learning becomes feasible for any course size or context, advancing long-standing goals of equity, access, and instructional capacity in education.

<summary><strong>MALBO: Optimizing LLM-Based Multi-Agent Teams via Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization</strong> - Antonio Sabbatella - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.11788)</summary>

**Abstract:** The optimal assignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) to specialized roles in multi-agent systems is a significant challenge, defined by a vast combinatorial search space, expensive black-box evaluations, and an inherent trade-off between performance and cost. Current optimization methods focus on single-agent settings and lack a principled framework for this multi-agent, multi-objective problem.
This thesis introduces MALBO (Multi-Agent LLM Bayesian Optimization), a systematic framework designed to automate the efficient composition of LLM-based agent teams. We formalize the assignment challenge as a multi-objective optimization problem, aiming to identify the Pareto front of configurations between task accuracy and inference cost. The methodology employs multi-objective Bayesian Optimization (MOBO) with independent Gaussian Process surrogate models. By searching over a continuous feature-space representation of the LLMs, this approach performs a sample-efficient exploration guided by the expected hypervolume improvement.
The primary contribution is a principled and automated methodology that yields a Pareto front of optimal team configurations. Our results demonstrate that the Bayesian optimization phase, compared to an initial random search, maintained a comparable average performance while reducing the average configuration cost by over 45%. Furthermore, MALBO identified specialized, heterogeneous teams that achieve cost reductions of up to 65.8% compared to homogeneous baselines, all while maintaining maximum performance. The framework thus provides a data-driven tool for deploying cost-effective and highly specialized multi-agent AI systems.

<summary><strong>From Single to Societal: Analyzing Persona-Induced Bias in Multi-Agent Interactions</strong> - Jiayi Li, Xiao Liu, Yansong Feng - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.11789)</summary>

**Abstract:** Large Language Model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems are increasingly used to simulate human interactions and solve collaborative tasks. A common practice is to assign agents with personas to encourage behavioral diversity. However, this raises a critical yet underexplored question: do personas introduce biases into multi-agent interactions? This paper presents a systematic investigation into persona-induced biases in multi-agent interactions, with a focus on social traits like trustworthiness (how an agent's opinion is received by others) and insistence (how strongly an agent advocates for its opinion). Through a series of controlled experiments in collaborative problem-solving and persuasion tasks, we reveal that (1) LLM-based agents exhibit biases in both trustworthiness and insistence, with personas from historically advantaged groups (e.g., men and White individuals) perceived as less trustworthy and demonstrating less insistence; and (2) agents exhibit significant in-group favoritism, showing a higher tendency to conform to others who share the same persona. These biases persist across various LLMs, group sizes, and numbers of interaction rounds, highlighting an urgent need for awareness and mitigation to ensure the fairness and reliability of multi-agent systems.

<summary><strong>Goal-Oriented Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Decentralized Agent Teams</strong> - Hung Du, Hy Nguyen, Srikanth Thudumu, Rajesh Vasa, Kon Mouzakis - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.11992)</summary>

**Abstract:** Connected and autonomous vehicles across land, water, and air must often operate in dynamic, unpredictable environments with limited communication, no centralized control, and partial observability. These real-world constraints pose significant challenges for coordination, particularly when vehicles pursue individual objectives. To address this, we propose a decentralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework that enables vehicles, acting as agents, to communicate selectively based on local goals and observations. This goal-aware communication strategy allows agents to share only relevant information, enhancing collaboration while respecting visibility limitations. We validate our approach in complex multi-agent navigation tasks featuring obstacles and dynamic agent populations. Results show that our method significantly improves task success rates and reduces time-to-goal compared to non-cooperative baselines. Moreover, task performance remains stable as the number of agents increases, demonstrating scalability. These findings highlight the potential of decentralized, goal-driven MARL to support effective coordination in realistic multi-vehicle systems operating across diverse domains.

<summary><strong>LLM-based Multi-Agent System for Simulating Strategic and Goal-Oriented Data Marketplaces</strong> - Jun Sashihara, Yukihisa Fujita, Kota Nakamura, Masahiro Kuwahara, Teruaki Hayashi - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.13233)</summary>

**Abstract:** Data marketplaces, which mediate the purchase and exchange of data from third parties, have attracted growing attention for reducing the cost and effort of data collection while enabling the trading of diverse datasets. However, a systematic understanding of the interactions between market participants, data, and regulations remains limited. To address this gap, we propose a Large Language Model-based Multi-Agent System (LLM-MAS) for data marketplaces. In our framework, buyer and seller agents powered by LLMs operate with explicit objectives and autonomously perform strategic actions, such as planning, searching, purchasing, pricing, and updating data. These agents can reason about market dynamics, forecast future demand, and adjust strategies accordingly. Unlike conventional model-based simulations, which are typically constrained to predefined rules, LLM-MAS supports broader and more adaptive behavior selection through natural language reasoning. We evaluated the framework via simulation experiments using three distribution-based metrics: (1) the number of purchases per dataset, (2) the number of purchases per buyer, and (3) the number of repeated purchases of the same dataset. The results demonstrate that LLM-MAS more faithfully reproduces trading patterns observed in real data marketplaces compared to traditional approaches, and further captures the emergence and evolution of market trends.

<summary><strong>Market-Dependent Communication in Multi-Agent Alpha Generation</strong> - Jerick Shi, Burton Hollifield - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.13614)</summary>

**Abstract:** Multi-strategy hedge funds face a fundamental organizational choice: should analysts generating trading strategies communicate, and if so, how? We investigate this using 5-agent LLM-based trading systems across 450 experiments spanning 21 months, comparing five organizational structures from isolated baseline to collaborative and competitive conversation. We show that communication improves performance, but optimal communication design depends on market characteristics. Competitive conversation excels in volatile technology stocks, while collaborative conversation dominates stable general stocks. Finance stocks resist all communication interventions. Surprisingly, all structures, including isolated agents, converge to similar strategy alignments, challenging assumptions that transparency causes harmful diversity loss. Performance differences stem from behavioral mechanisms: competitive agents focus on stock-level allocation while collaborative agents develop technical frameworks. Conversation quality scores show zero correlation with returns. These findings demonstrate that optimal communication design must match market volatility characteristics, and sophisticated discussions don't guarantee better performance.

<summary><strong>Transformer-Based Scalable Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Networked Systems with Long-Range Interactions</strong> - Vidur Sinha, Muhammed Ustaomeroglu, Guannan Qu - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.13103)</summary>

**Abstract:** Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has shown promise for large-scale network control, yet existing methods face two major limitations. First, they typically rely on assumptions leading to decay properties of local agent interactions, limiting their ability to capture long-range dependencies such as cascading power failures or epidemic outbreaks. Second, most approaches lack generalizability across network topologies, requiring retraining when applied to new graphs. We introduce STACCA (Shared Transformer Actor-Critic with Counterfactual Advantage), a unified transformer-based MARL framework that addresses both challenges. STACCA employs a centralized Graph Transformer Critic to model long-range dependencies and provide system-level feedback, while its shared Graph Transformer Actor learns a generalizable policy capable of adapting across diverse network structures. Further, to improve credit assignment during training, STACCA integrates a novel counterfactual advantage estimator that is compatible with state-value critic estimates. We evaluate STACCA on epidemic containment and rumor-spreading network control tasks, demonstrating improved performance, network generalization, and scalability. These results highlight the potential of transformer-based MARL architectures to achieve scalable and generalizable control in large-scale networked systems.

<summary><strong>Agent-Oriented Visual Programming for the Web of Things</strong> - Samuele Burattini, Alessandro Ricci, Simon Mayer, Danai Vachtsevanou, Jeremy Lemee, Andrei Ciortea, Angelo Croatti - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.13158)</summary>

**Abstract:** In this paper we introduce and discuss an approach for multi-agent-oriented visual programming. This aims at enabling individuals without programming experience but with knowledge in specific target domains to design and (re)configure autonomous software. We argue that, compared to procedural programming, it should be simpler for users to create programs when agent abstractions are employed. The underlying rationale is that these abstractions, and specifically the belief-desire-intention architecture that is aligned with human practical reasoning, match more closely with people's everyday experience in interacting with other agents and artifacts in the real world. On top of this, we designed and implemented a visual programming system for agents that hides the technicalities of agent-oriented programming using a blocks-based visual development environment that is built on the JaCaMo platform. To further validate the proposed solution, we integrate the Web of Things (WoT) to let users create autonomous behaviour on top of physical mashups of devices, following the trends in industrial end-user programming. Finally, we report on a pilot user study where we verified that novice users are indeed able to make use of this development environment to create multi-agent systems to solve simple automation tasks.

<summary><strong>Efficient Multiagent Planning via Shared Action Suggestions</strong> - Dylan M. Asmar, Mykel J. Kochenderfer - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.11430)</summary>

**Abstract:** Decentralized partially observable Markov decision processes with communication (Dec-POMDP-Com) provide a framework for multiagent decision making under uncertainty, but the NEXP-complete complexity for finite-horizon problems renders solutions intractable in general. While sharing actions and observations can reduce the complexity to PSPACE-complete, we propose an approach that bridges POMDPs and Dec-POMDPs by communicating only suggested joint actions, eliminating the need to share observations while retaining near-centralized performance. Our algorithm estimates joint beliefs using shared actions to prune infeasible beliefs. Each agent maintains possible belief sets for other agents, pruning them based on suggested actions to form an estimated joint belief usable with any centralized policy. This approach requires solving a POMDP for each agent, reducing computational complexity while preserving performance. We demonstrate its effectiveness on several Dec-POMDP benchmarks, showing performance comparable to centralized methods when shared actions enable effective belief pruning. This action-based communication framework offers a natural avenue for integrating human-agent cooperation, opening new directions for scalable multiagent planning under uncertainty, with applications in both autonomous systems and human-agent teams.

<summary><strong>LLM-Enhanced Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Expert Workflow for Real-Time P2P Energy Trading</strong> - Chengwei Lou, Zekai Jin, Wei Tang, Guangfei Geng, Jin Yang, Lu Zhang - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.14995)</summary>

**Abstract:** Real-time peer-to-peer (P2P) electricity markets dynamically adapt to fluctuations in renewable energy and variations in demand, maximizing economic benefits through instantaneous price responses while enhancing grid flexibility. However, scaling expert guidance for massive personalized prosumers poses critical challenges, including diverse decision-making demands and lack of customized modeling frameworks. This paper proposed an integrated large language model-multi-agent reinforcement learning (LLM-MARL) framework for real-time P2P energy trading to address challenges such as the limited technical capability of prosumers, the lack of expert experience, and security issues of distribution networks. LLMs are introduced as experts to generate personalized strategy, guiding MARL under the centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) paradigm through imitation learning. A differential attention-based critic network is designed to enhance convergence performance. Experimental results demonstrate that LLM generated strategies effectively substitute human experts. The proposed multi-agent imitation learning algorithms achieve significantly lower economic costs and voltage violation rates on test sets compared to baselines algorithms, while maintaining robust stability. This work provides an effective solution for real-time P2P electricity market decision-making by bridging expert knowledge with agent learning.

<summary><strong>Local Guidance for Configuration-Based Multi-Agent Pathfinding</strong> - Tomoki Arita, Keisuke Okumura - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.19072)</summary>

**Abstract:** Guidance is an emerging concept that improves the empirical performance of real-time, sub-optimal multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) methods. It offers additional information to MAPF algorithms to mitigate congestion on a global scale by considering the collective behavior of all agents across the entire workspace. This global perspective helps reduce agents' waiting times, thereby improving overall coordination efficiency. In contrast, this study explores an alternative approach: providing local guidance in the vicinity of each agent. While such localized methods involve recomputation as agents move and may appear computationally demanding, we empirically demonstrate that supplying informative spatiotemporal cues to the planner can significantly improve solution quality without exceeding a moderate time budget. When applied to LaCAM, a leading configuration-based solver, this form of guidance establishes a new performance frontier for MAPF.

<summary><strong>Harnessing Diverse Perspectives: A Multi-Agent Framework for Enhanced Error Detection in Knowledge Graphs</strong> - Yu Li, Yi Huang, Guilin Qi, Junlan Feng, Nan Hu, Songlin Zhai, Haohan Xue, Yongrui Chen, Ruoyan Shen, Tongtong Wu - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.15791)</summary>

**Abstract:** Knowledge graphs are widely used in industrial applications, making error detection crucial for ensuring the reliability of downstream applications. Existing error detection methods often fail to effectively utilize fine-grained subgraph information and rely solely on fixed graph structures, while also lacking transparency in their decision-making processes, which results in suboptimal detection performance. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-Agent framework for Knowledge Graph Error Detection (MAKGED) that utilizes multiple large language models (LLMs) in a collaborative setting. By concatenating fine-grained, bidirectional subgraph embeddings with LLM-based query embeddings during training, our framework integrates these representations to produce four specialized agents. These agents utilize subgraph information from different dimensions to engage in multi-round discussions, thereby improving error detection accuracy and ensuring a transparent decision-making process. Extensive experiments on FB15K and WN18RR demonstrate that MAKGED outperforms state-of-the-art methods, enhancing the accuracy and robustness of KG evaluation. For specific industrial scenarios, our framework can facilitate the training of specialized agents using domain-specific knowledge graphs for error detection, which highlights the potential industrial application value of our framework.

<summary><strong>CAMAR: Continuous Actions Multi-Agent Routing</strong> - Artem Pshenitsyn, Aleksandr Panov, Alexey Skrynnik - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.12845)</summary>

**Abstract:** Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is a powerful paradigm for solving cooperative and competitive decision-making problems. While many MARL benchmarks have been proposed, few combine continuous state and action spaces with challenging coordination and planning tasks. We introduce CAMAR, a new MARL benchmark designed explicitly for multi-agent pathfinding in environments with continuous actions. CAMAR supports cooperative and competitive interactions between agents and runs efficiently at up to 100,000 environment steps per second. We also propose a three-tier evaluation protocol to better track algorithmic progress and enable deeper analysis of performance. In addition, CAMAR allows the integration of classical planning methods such as RRT and RRT* into MARL pipelines. We use them as standalone baselines and combine RRT* with popular MARL algorithms to create hybrid approaches. We provide a suite of test scenarios and benchmarking tools to ensure reproducibility and fair comparison. Experiments show that CAMAR presents a challenging and realistic testbed for the MARL community.

**Abstract:** Recent advances in large language models have enabled AI systems to achieve expert-level performance on domain-specific scientific tasks, yet these systems remain narrow and handcrafted. We introduce SciAgent, a unified multi-agent system designed for generalistic scientific reasoning-the ability to adapt reasoning strategies across disciplines and difficulty levels. SciAgent organizes problem solving as a hierarchical process: a Coordinator Agent interprets each problem's domain and complexity, dynamically orchestrating specialized Worker Systems, each composed of interacting reasoning Sub-agents for symbolic deduction, conceptual modeling, numerical computation, and verification. These agents collaboratively assemble and refine reasoning pipelines tailored to each task. Across mathematics and physics Olympiads (IMO, IMC, IPhO, CPhO), SciAgent consistently attains or surpasses human gold-medalist performance, demonstrating both domain generality and reasoning adaptability. Additionally, SciAgent has been tested on the International Chemistry Olympiad (IChO) and selected problems from the Humanity's Last Exam (HLE) benchmark, further confirming the system's ability to generalize across diverse scientific domains. This work establishes SciAgent as a concrete step toward generalistic scientific intelligence-AI systems capable of coherent, cross-disciplinary reasoning at expert levels.

**Abstract:** Notice to Air Missions (NOTAMs) serve as a critical channel for disseminating key flight safety information, yet their complex linguistic structures and implicit reasoning pose significant challenges for automated parsing. Existing research mainly focuses on surface-level tasks such as classification and named entity recognition, lacking deep semantic understanding. To address this gap, we propose NOTAM semantic parsing, a task emphasizing semantic inference and the integration of aviation domain knowledge to produce structured, inference-rich outputs. To support this task, we construct Knots (Knowledge and NOTAM Semantics), a high-quality dataset of 12,347 expert-annotated NOTAMs covering 194 Flight Information Regions, enhanced through a multi-agent collaborative framework for comprehensive field discovery. We systematically evaluate a wide range of prompt-engineering strategies and model-adaptation techniques, achieving substantial improvements in aviation text understanding and processing. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and offer valuable insights for automated NOTAM analysis systems. Our code is available at: this https URL.

<summary><strong>Extracting Events Like Code: A Multi-Agent Programming Framework for Zero-Shot Event Extraction</strong> - Quanjiang Guo, Sijie Wang, Jinchuan Zhang, Ben Zhang, Zhao Kang, Ling Tian, Ke Yan - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.13118)</summary>

**Abstract:** Zero-shot event extraction (ZSEE) remains a significant challenge for large language models (LLMs) due to the need for complex reasoning and domain-specific understanding. Direct prompting often yields incomplete or structurally invalid outputs--such as misclassified triggers, missing arguments, and schema violations. To address these limitations, we present Agent-Event-Coder (AEC), a novel multi-agent framework that treats event extraction like software engineering: as a structured, iterative code-generation process. AEC decomposes ZSEE into specialized subtasks--retrieval, planning, coding, and verification--each handled by a dedicated LLM agent. Event schemas are represented as executable class definitions, enabling deterministic validation and precise feedback via a verification agent. This programming-inspired approach allows for systematic disambiguation and schema enforcement through iterative refinement. By leveraging collaborative agent workflows, AEC enables LLMs to produce precise, complete, and schema-consistent extractions in zero-shot settings. Experiments across five diverse domains and six LLMs demonstrate that AEC consistently outperforms prior zero-shot baselines, showcasing the power of treating event extraction like code generation. The code and data are released on this https URL.

<summary><strong>MAPLE: Multi-Agent Adaptive Planning with Long-Term Memory for Table Reasoning</strong> - Ye Bai, Minghan Wang, Thuy-Trang Vu - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.05813)</summary>

**Abstract:** Table-based question answering requires complex reasoning capabilities that current LLMs struggle to achieve with single-pass inference. Existing approaches, such as Chain-of-Thought reasoning and question decomposition, lack error detection mechanisms and discard problem-solving experiences, contrasting sharply with how humans tackle such problems. In this paper, we propose MAPLE (Multi-agent Adaptive Planning with Long-term mEmory), a novel framework that mimics human problem-solving through specialized cognitive agents working in a feedback-driven loop. MAPLE integrates 4 key components: (1) a Solver using the ReAct paradigm for reasoning, (2) a Checker for answer verification, (3) a Reflector for error diagnosis and strategy correction, and (4) an Archiver managing long-term memory for experience reuse and evolution. Experiments on WiKiTQ and TabFact demonstrate significant improvements over existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple LLM backbones.

**Abstract:** Large Language Model (LLM)-powered multi-agent systems (MAS) have rapidly advanced collaborative reasoning, tool use, and role-specialized coordination in complex tasks. However, reliability-critical deployment remains hindered by a systemic failure mode: hierarchical compliance under instruction conflicts (system-user, peer-peer), where agents misprioritize system-level rules in the presence of competing demands. Moreover, widely used macro-level metrics (e.g., pass@k) obscure these micro-level violations and offer little actionable guidance for remedy. In this work, we present a full-stack, three-stage framework: (1) Diagnose - Contextualized Role Adherence Score (CRAS), a query-wise, context-aware scoring metric that decomposes role adherence into four measurable dimensions; (2) Localize - attention drift analysis revealing that instruction conflicts are resolved by attention heads that are largely concentrated in middle layers; (3) Align - Surgical Alignment of Instruction Layers (SAIL), which installs LoRA only on the localized focal layers and optimizes a token-weighted DPO-style preference objective that credits tokens by their focal attentional contribution. Across standard benchmarks and MAS frameworks, our surgical approach improves instruction hierarchy compliance (e.g., +5.60% with AutoGen on MedQA) without full-model finetuning.

**Abstract:** In cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), efficient exploration is crucial for optimizing the performance of joint policy. However, existing methods often update joint policies via independent agent exploration, without coordination among agents, which inherently constrains the expressive capacity and exploration of joint policies. To address this issue, we propose a conductor-based joint policy framework that directly enhances the expressive capacity of joint policies and coordinates exploration. In addition, we develop a Hierarchical Conductor-based Policy Optimization (HCPO) algorithm that instructs policy updates for the conductor and agents in a direction aligned with performance improvement. A rigorous theoretical guarantee further establishes the monotonicity of the joint policy optimization process. By deploying local conductors, HCPO retains centralized training benefits while eliminating inter-agent communication during execution. Finally, we evaluate HCPO on three challenging benchmarks: StarCraftII Multi-agent Challenge, Multi-agent MuJoCo, and Multi-agent Particle Environment. The results indicate that HCPO outperforms competitive MARL baselines regarding cooperative efficiency and stability.

<summary><strong>Game-Theoretic Safe Multi-Agent Motion Planning with Reachability Analysis for Dynamic and Uncertain Environments (Extended Version)</strong> - Wenbin Mai, Minghui Liwang, Xinlei Yi, Xiaoyu Xia, Seyyedali Hosseinalipour, Xianbin Wang - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.12160)</summary>

**Abstract:** Ensuring safe, robust, and scalable motion planning for multi-agent systems in dynamic and uncertain environments is a persistent challenge, driven by complex inter-agent interactions, stochastic disturbances, and model uncertainties. To overcome these challenges, particularly the computational complexity of coupled decision-making and the need for proactive safety guarantees, we propose a Reachability-Enhanced Dynamic Potential Game (RE-DPG) framework, which integrates game-theoretic coordination into reachability analysis. This approach formulates multi-agent coordination as a dynamic potential game, where the Nash equilibrium (NE) defines optimal control strategies across agents. To enable scalability and decentralized execution, we develop a Neighborhood-Dominated iterative Best Response (ND-iBR) scheme, built upon an iterated $\varepsilon$-BR (i$\varepsilon$-BR) process that guarantees finite-step convergence to an $\varepsilon$-NE. This allows agents to compute strategies based on local interactions while ensuring theoretical convergence guarantees. Furthermore, to ensure safety under uncertainty, we integrate a Multi-Agent Forward Reachable Set (MA-FRS) mechanism into the cost function, explicitly modeling uncertainty propagation and enforcing collision avoidance constraints. Through both simulations and real-world experiments in 2D and 3D environments, we validate the effectiveness of RE-DPG across diverse operational scenarios.

<summary><strong>Density-Driven Multi-Agent Coordination for Efficient Farm Coverage and Management in Smart Agriculture</strong> - Sungjun Seo, Kooktae Lee - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.12492)</summary>

**Abstract:** The growing scale of modern farms has increased the need for efficient and adaptive multi-agent coverage strategies for pest, weed, and disease management. Traditional methods such as manual inspection and blanket pesticide spraying often lead to excessive chemical use, resource waste, and environmental impact. While unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) offer a promising platform for precision agriculture through targeted spraying and improved operational efficiency, existing UAV-based approaches remain limited by battery life, payload capacity, and scalability, especially in large fields where single-UAV or uniformly distributed spraying is insufficient. Although multi-UAV coordination has been explored, many current frameworks still assume uniform spraying and do not account for infestation severity, UAV dynamics, non-uniform resource allocation, or energy-efficient coordination.
To address these limitations, this paper proposes a Density-Driven Optimal Control (D2OC) framework that integrates Optimal Transport (OT) theory with multi-UAV coverage control for large-scale agricultural spraying. The method supports non-uniform, priority-aware resource allocation based on infestation intensity, reducing unnecessary chemical application. UAVs are modeled as a linear time-varying (LTV) system to capture variations in mass and inertia during spraying missions. The D2OC control law, derived using Lagrangian mechanics, enables efficient coordination, balanced workload distribution, and improved mission duration. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms uniform spraying and Spectral Multiscale Coverage (SMC) in coverage efficiency, chemical reduction, and operational sustainability, providing a scalable solution for smart agriculture.

**Abstract:** This paper addresses the fundamental problem of non-uniform area coverage in multi-agent systems, where different regions require varying levels of attention due to mission-dependent priorities. Existing uniform coverage strategies are insufficient for realistic applications, and many non-uniform approaches either lack optimality guarantees or fail to incorporate crucial real-world constraints such as agent dynamics, limited operation time, the number of agents, and decentralized execution.
To resolve these limitations, we propose a novel framework called Density-Driven Optimal Control (D2OC). The central idea of D2OC is the integration of optimal transport theory with multi-agent coverage control, enabling each agent to continuously adjust its trajectory to match a mission-specific reference density map. The proposed formulation establishes optimality by solving a constrained optimization problem that explicitly incorporates physical and operational constraints. The resulting control input is analytically derived from the Lagrangian of the objective function, yielding closed-form optimal solutions for linear systems and a generalizable structure for nonlinear systems. Furthermore, a decentralized data-sharing mechanism is developed to coordinate agents without reliance on global information.
Comprehensive simulation studies demonstrate that D2OC achieves significantly improved non-uniform area coverage performance compared to existing methods, while maintaining scalability and decentralized implementability.

<summary><strong>BeautyGuard: Designing a Multi-Agent Roundtable System for Proactive Beauty Tech Compliance through Stakeholder Collaboration</strong> - Junwei Li, Wenqing Wang, Huiliu Mao, Jiazhe Ni, Zeyu Xiong - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.12645)</summary>

**Abstract:** As generative AI enters enterprise workflows, ensuring compliance with legal, ethical, and reputational standards becomes a pressing challenge. In beauty tech, where biometric and personal data are central, traditional reviews are often manual, fragmented, and reactive. To examine these challenges, we conducted a formative study with six experts (four IT managers, two legal managers) at a multinational beauty company. The study revealed pain points in rule checking, precedent use, and the lack of proactive guidance.
Motivated by these findings, we designed a multi-agent "roundtable" system powered by a large language model. The system assigns role-specialized agents for legal interpretation, checklist review, precedent search, and risk mitigation, synthesizing their perspectives into structured compliance advice.
We evaluated the prototype with the same experts using System Usability Scale(SUS), The Official NASA Task Load Index(NASA-TLX), and interviews. Results show exceptional usability (SUS: 77.5/100) and minimal cognitive workload, with three key findings: (1) multi-agent systems can preserve tacit knowledge into standardized workflows, (2) information augmentation achieves higher acceptance than decision automation, and (3) successful enterprise AI should mirror organizational structures. This work contributes design principles for human-AI collaboration in compliance review, with broader implications for regulated industries beyond beauty tech.

**Abstract:** With the rapid rise of large language models (LLMs), phone automation has undergone transformative changes. This paper systematically reviews LLM-driven phone GUI agents, highlighting their evolution from script-based automation to intelligent, adaptive systems. We first contextualize key challenges, (i) limited generality, (ii) high maintenance overhead, and (iii) weak intent comprehension, and show how LLMs address these issues through advanced language understanding, multimodal perception, and robust decision-making. We then propose a taxonomy covering fundamental agent frameworks (single-agent, multi-agent, plan-then-act), modeling approaches (prompt engineering, training-based), and essential datasets and benchmarks. Furthermore, we detail task-specific architectures, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning strategies that bridge user intent and GUI operations. Finally, we discuss open challenges such as dataset diversity, on-device deployment efficiency, user-centric adaptation, and security concerns, offering forward-looking insights into this rapidly evolving field. By providing a structured overview and identifying pressing research gaps, this paper serves as a definitive reference for researchers and practitioners seeking to harness LLMs in designing scalable, user-friendly phone GUI agents.

<summary><strong>MedBuild AI: An Agent-Based Hybrid Intelligence Framework for Reshaping Agency in Healthcare Infrastructure Planning through Generative Design for Medical Architecture</strong> - Yiming Zhang, Yuejia Xu, Ziyao Wang, Xin Yan, Xiaosai Hao - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.11587)</summary>

**Abstract:** Globally, disparities in healthcare infrastructure remain stark, leaving countless communities without access to even basic services. Traditional infrastructure planning is often slow and inaccessible, and although many architects are actively delivering humanitarian and aid-driven hospital projects worldwide, these vital efforts still fall far short of the sheer scale and urgency of demand. This paper introduces MedBuild AI, a hybrid-intelligence framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) with deterministic expert systems to rebalance the early design and conceptual planning stages. As a web-based platform, it enables any region with satellite internet access to obtain guidance on modular, low-tech, low-cost medical building designs. The system operates through three agents: the first gathers local health intelligence via conversational interaction; the second translates this input into an architectural functional program through rule-based computation; and the third generates layouts and 3D models. By embedding computational negotiation into the design process, MedBuild AI fosters a reciprocal, inclusive, and equitable approach to healthcare planning, empowering communities and redefining agency in global healthcare architecture.

<summary><strong>ExpertAD: Enhancing Autonomous Driving Systems with Mixture of Experts</strong> - Haowen Jiang, Xinyu Huang, You Lu, Dingji Wang, Yuheng Cao, Chaofeng Sha, Bihuan Chen, Keyu Chen, Xin Peng - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.11740)</summary>

**Abstract:** Recent advancements in end-to-end autonomous driving systems (ADSs) underscore their potential for perception and planning capabilities. However, challenges remain. Complex driving scenarios contain rich semantic information, yet ambiguous or noisy semantics can compromise decision reliability, while interference between multiple driving tasks may hinder optimal planning. Furthermore, prolonged inference latency slows decision-making, increasing the risk of unsafe driving behaviors. To address these challenges, we propose ExpertAD, a novel framework that enhances the performance of ADS with Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture. We introduce a Perception Adapter (PA) to amplify task-critical features, ensuring contextually relevant scene understanding, and a Mixture of Sparse Experts (MoSE) to minimize task interference during prediction, allowing for effective and efficient planning. Our experiments show that ExpertAD reduces average collision rates by up to 20% and inference latency by 25% compared to prior methods. We further evaluate its multi-skill planning capabilities in rare scenarios (e.g., accidents, yielding to emergency vehicles) and demonstrate strong generalization to unseen urban environments. Additionally, we present a case study that illustrates its decision-making process in complex driving scenarios.

<summary><strong>Autonomous Underwater Cognitive System for Adaptive Navigation: A SLAM-Integrated Cognitive Architecture</strong> - K. A. I. N Jayarathne, R. M. N. M. Rathnayaka, D. P. S. S. Peiris - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.11845)</summary>

**Abstract:** Deep-sea exploration poses significant challenges, including disorientation, communication loss, and navigational failures in dynamic underwater environments. This paper presents an Autonomous Underwater Cognitive System (AUCS) that integrates Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) with a Soar-based cognitive architecture to enable adaptive navigation in complex oceanic conditions. The system fuses multi-sensor data from SONAR, LiDAR, IMU, and DVL with cognitive reasoning modules for perception, attention, planning, and learning. Unlike conventional SLAM systems, AUCS incorporates semantic understanding, adaptive sensor management, and memory-based learning to differentiate between dynamic and static objects, reducing false loop closures and enhancing long-term map consistency. The proposed architecture demonstrates a complete perception-cognition-action-learning loop, allowing autonomous underwater vehicles to sense, reason, and adapt intelligently. This work lays a foundation for next-generation cognitive submersible systems, improving safety, reliability, and autonomy in deep-sea exploration.

<summary><strong>Fact2Fiction: Targeted Poisoning Attack to Agentic Fact-checking System</strong> - Haorui He, Yupeng Li, Bin Benjamin Zhu, Dacheng Wen, Reynold Cheng, Francis C. M. Lau - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.06059)</summary>

**Abstract:** State-of-the-art (SOTA) fact-checking systems combat misinformation by employing autonomous LLM-based agents to decompose complex claims into smaller sub-claims, verify each sub-claim individually, and aggregate the partial results to produce verdicts with justifications (explanations for the verdicts). The security of these systems is crucial, as compromised fact-checkers can amplify misinformation, but remains largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, this work introduces a novel threat model against such fact-checking systems and presents \textsc{Fact2Fiction}, the first poisoning attack framework targeting SOTA agentic fact-checking systems. Fact2Fiction employs LLMs to mimic the decomposition strategy and exploit system-generated justifications to craft tailored malicious evidences that compromise sub-claim verification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Fact2Fiction achieves 8.9\%--21.2\% higher attack success rates than SOTA attacks across various poisoning budgets and exposes security weaknesses in existing fact-checking systems, highlighting the need for defensive countermeasures.

<summary><strong>Target Defense against Sequentially Arriving Intruders: Algorithm for Agents with Dubins Dynamics</strong> - Arman Pourghorban, Dipankar Maity - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.12329)</summary>

**Abstract:** We consider a variant of the target defense problem where a single defender is tasked to capture a sequence of incoming intruders. Both the defender and the intruders have non-holonomic dynamics. The intruders' objective is to breach the target perimeter without being captured by the defender, while the defender's goal is to capture as many intruders as possible. After one intruder breaches or is captured, the next appears randomly on a fixed circle surrounding the target. Therefore, the defender's final position in one game becomes its starting position for the next. We divide an intruder-defender engagement into two phases, partial information and full information, depending on the information available to the players. We address the capturability of an intruder by the defender using the notions of Dubins path and guarding arc. We quantify the percentage of capture for both finite and infinite sequences of incoming intruders. Finally, the theoretical results are verified through numerical examples using Monte-Carlo-type random trials of experiments.

<summary><strong>Large-Scale Multi-Robot Assembly Planning for Autonomous Manufacturing</strong> - Kyle Brown, Dylan M. Asmar, Mac Schwager, Mykel J. Kochenderfer - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.00192)</summary>

**Abstract:** Mobile autonomous robots have the potential to revolutionize manufacturing processes. However, employing large robot fleets in manufacturing requires addressing challenges including collision-free movement in a shared workspace, effective multi-robot collaboration to manipulate and transport large payloads, complex task allocation due to coupled manufacturing processes, and spatial planning for parallel assembly and transportation of nested subassemblies. We propose a full algorithmic stack for large-scale multi-robot assembly planning that addresses these challenges and can synthesize construction plans for complex assemblies with thousands of parts in a matter of minutes. Our approach takes in a CAD-like product specification and automatically plans a full-stack assembly procedure for a group of robots to manufacture the product. We propose an algorithmic stack that comprises: (i) an iterative radial layout optimization procedure to define a global staging layout for the manufacturing facility, (ii) a graph-repair mixed-integer program formulation and a modified greedy task allocation algorithm to optimally allocate robots and robot sub-teams to assembly and transport tasks, (iii) a geometric heuristic and a hill-climbing algorithm to plan collaborative carrying configurations of robot sub-teams, and (iv) a distributed control policy that enables robots to execute the assembly motion plan collision-free. We also present an open-source multi-robot manufacturing simulator implemented in Julia as a resource to the research community, to test our algorithms and to facilitate multi-robot manufacturing research more broadly. Our empirical results demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of our approach by generating plans to manufacture a LEGO model of a Saturn V launch vehicle with 1845 parts, 306 subassemblies, and 250 robots in under three minutes on a standard laptop computer.

<summary><strong>Sequential Autonomous Exploration-Based Precise Mapping for Mobile Robots through Stepwise and Consistent Motions</strong> - Muhua Zhang, Lei Ma, Ying Wu, Kai Shen, Yongkui Sun, Henry Leung - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.17005)</summary>

**Abstract:** This paper proposes a 2-D autonomous exploration and mapping framework for LiDAR-based SLAM mobile robots, designed to address the major challenges on low-cost platforms, including process instability, map drift, and increased risks of collisions and deadlocks. For frontier search, the local-global sampling architecture based on Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRTs) is employed. For local exploration, the proposed Self-Convergent RRT (SC-RRT) efficiently covers the reachable space within a finite time while the robot remains stationary, without relying on motion-induced sampling diversity. In addition, traversability checks during RRT expansion and global RRT pruning upon map updates eliminate unreachable frontiers, reducing potential collisions and deadlocks. For frontier point navigation, a stepwise consistent motion strategy is employed to generate motion trajectories that are more amenable to stable scan matching. The resulting straight-segment and in-place-rotation pattern improves scan-matching robustness and effectively suppresses map drift on resource-constrained platforms. For the process control, the framework serializes frontier point selection and navigation, avoiding oscillations caused by frequent goal changes in conventional parallelized processes. The waypoint retracing mechanism is incorporated to generate repeated observations, triggering loop closure detection and backend optimization in graph-based SLAM, thereby improving map consistency. Experiments in challenging simulated and real-world environments validate the effectiveness of the framework. Compared with baseline methods, the proposed framework achieves higher mapping success rates and stronger robustness on resource-constrained robots and maintains consistent mapping quality across various LiDAR field-of-view (FoV) configurations.

<summary><strong>Value-Aligned Prompt Moderation via Zero-Shot Agentic Rewriting for Safe Image Generation</strong> - Xin Zhao, Xiaojun Chen, Bingshan Liu, Zeyao Liu, Zhendong Zhao, Xiaoyan Gu - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.11693)</summary>

**Abstract:** Generative vision-language models like Stable Diffusion demonstrate remarkable capabilities in creative media synthesis, but they also pose substantial risks of producing unsafe, offensive, or culturally inappropriate content when prompted adversarially. Current defenses struggle to align outputs with human values without sacrificing generation quality or incurring high costs. To address these challenges, we introduce VALOR (Value-Aligned LLM-Overseen Rewriter), a modular, zero-shot agentic framework for safer and more helpful text-to-image generation. VALOR integrates layered prompt analysis with human-aligned value reasoning: a multi-level NSFW detector filters lexical and semantic risks; a cultural value alignment module identifies violations of social norms, legality, and representational ethics; and an intention disambiguator detects subtle or indirect unsafe implications. When unsafe content is detected, prompts are selectively rewritten by a large language model under dynamic, role-specific instructions designed to preserve user intent while enforcing alignment. If the generated image still fails a safety check, VALOR optionally performs a stylistic regeneration to steer the output toward a safer visual domain without altering core semantics. Experiments across adversarial, ambiguous, and value-sensitive prompts show that VALOR significantly reduces unsafe outputs by up to 100.00% while preserving prompt usefulness and creativity. These results highlight VALOR as a scalable and effective approach for deploying safe, aligned, and helpful image generation systems in open-world settings.

<summary><strong>Learning to Refine: An Agentic RL Approach for Iterative SPARQL Query Construction</strong> - Floris Vossebeld, Shenghui Wang - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.11770)</summary>

**Abstract:** Generating complex, logically-sound SPARQL queries for multi-hop questions remains a critical bottleneck for Knowledge Graph Question Answering, as the brittle nature of one-shot generation by Large Language Models (LLMs) hinders reliable interaction with structured data. Current methods lack the adaptive policies needed to dynamically debug queries based on real-time execution feedback. This paper introduces a novel agentic framework where an LLM learns a resilient policy for the sequential process of iterative SPARQL construction. We show that a compact 3B-parameter model, trained exclusively via outcome-driven Reinforcement Learning (GRPO) without supervised fine-tuning, can learn effective policies for this task, discovering how to systematically recover from execution errors and refine its queries toward a correct answer. On a curated, executable single-answer subset of LC-QuAD 2.0, our agent achieves 49.7\% accuracy post-entity-linking, a significant 17.5 percentage point improvement over the strongest iterative zero-shot baseline. Further analysis reveals that while the agent's capability is driven by RL, its performance is enhanced by an explicit deliberative reasoning step that acts as a cognitive scaffold to improve policy precision. This work presents a generalizable blueprint for teaching agents to master formal, symbolic tools through interaction, bridging the gap between probabilistic LLMs and the structured world of Knowledge Graphs.

<summary><strong>Look As You Think: Unifying Reasoning and Visual Evidence Attribution for Verifiable Document RAG via Reinforcement Learning</strong> - Shuochen Liu, Pengfei Luo, Chao Zhang, Yuhao Chen, Haotian Zhang, Qi Liu, Xin Kou, Tong Xu, Enhong Chen - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.12003)</summary>

**Abstract:** Aiming to identify precise evidence sources from visual documents, visual evidence attribution for visual document retrieval-augmented generation (VD-RAG) ensures reliable and verifiable predictions from vision-language models (VLMs) in multimodal question answering. Most existing methods adopt end-to-end training to facilitate intuitive answer verification. However, they lack fine-grained supervision and progressive traceability throughout the reasoning process. In this paper, we introduce the Chain-of-Evidence (CoE) paradigm for VD-RAG. CoE unifies Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and visual evidence attribution by grounding reference elements in reasoning steps to specific regions with bounding boxes and page indexes. To enable VLMs to generate such evidence-grounded reasoning, we propose Look As You Think (LAT), a reinforcement learning framework that trains models to produce verifiable reasoning paths with consistent attribution. During training, LAT evaluates the attribution consistency of each evidence region and provides rewards only when the CoE trajectory yields correct answers, encouraging process-level self-verification. Experiments on vanilla Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct with Paper- and Wiki-VISA benchmarks show that LAT consistently improves the vanilla model in both single- and multi-image settings, yielding average gains of 8.23% in soft exact match (EM) and 47.0% in IoU@0.5. Meanwhile, LAT not only outperforms the supervised fine-tuning baseline, which is trained to directly produce answers with attribution, but also exhibits stronger generalization across domains.

<summary><strong>Intelligent Collaborative Optimization for Rubber Tyre Film Production Based on Multi-path Differentiated Clipping Proximal Policy Optimization</strong> - Yinghao Ruan, Wei Pang, Shuaihao Liu, Huili Yang, Leyi Han, Xinghui Dong - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.12060)</summary>

**Abstract:** The advent of smart manufacturing is addressing the limitations of traditional centralized scheduling and inflexible production line configurations in the rubber tyre industry, especially in terms of coping with dynamic production demands. Contemporary tyre manufacturing systems form complex networks of tightly coupled subsystems pronounced nonlinear interactions and emergent dynamics. This complexity renders the effective coordination of multiple subsystems, posing an essential yet formidable task. For high-dimensional, multi-objective optimization problems in this domain, we introduce a deep reinforcement learning algorithm: Multi-path Differentiated Clipping Proximal Policy Optimization (MPD-PPO). This algorithm employs a multi-branch policy architecture with differentiated gradient clipping constraints to ensure stable and efficient high-dimensional policy updates. Validated through experiments on width and thickness control in rubber tyre film production, MPD-PPO demonstrates substantial improvements in both tuning accuracy and operational efficiency. The framework successfully tackles key challenges, including high dimensionality, multi-objective trade-offs, and dynamic adaptation, thus delivering enhanced performance and production stability for real-time industrial deployment in tyre manufacturing.

<summary><strong>UpBench: A Dynamically Evolving Real-World Labor-Market Agentic Benchmark Framework Built for Human-Centric AI</strong> - Darvin Yi, Teng Liu, Mattie Terzolo, Lance Hasson, Ayan Sinh, Pablo Mendes, Andrew Rabinovich - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.12306)</summary>

**Abstract:** As large language model (LLM) agents increasingly undertake digital work, reliable frameworks are needed to evaluate their real-world competence, adaptability, and capacity for human collaboration. Existing benchmarks remain largely static, synthetic, or domain-limited, providing limited insight into how agents perform in dynamic, economically meaningful environments. We introduce UpBench, a dynamically evolving benchmark grounded in real jobs drawn from the global Upwork labor marketplace. Each task corresponds to a verified client transaction, anchoring evaluation in genuine work activity and financial outcomes. UpBench employs a rubric-based evaluation framework, in which expert freelancers decompose each job into detailed, verifiable acceptance criteria and assess AI submissions with per-criterion feedback. This structure enables fine-grained analysis of model strengths, weaknesses, and instruction-following fidelity beyond binary pass/fail metrics. Human expertise is integrated throughout the data pipeline (from job curation and rubric construction to evaluation) ensuring fidelity to real professional standards and supporting research on human-AI collaboration. By regularly refreshing tasks to reflect the evolving nature of online work, UpBench provides a scalable, human-centered foundation for evaluating agentic systems in authentic labor-market contexts, offering a path toward a collaborative framework, where AI amplifies human capability through partnership rather than replacement.

<summary><strong>More Than Irrational: Modeling Belief-Biased Agents</strong> - Yifan Zhu, Sammie Katt, Samuel Kaski - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.12359)</summary>

**Abstract:** Despite the explosive growth of AI and the technologies built upon it, predicting and inferring the sub-optimal behavior of users or human collaborators remains a critical challenge. In many cases, such behaviors are not a result of irrationality, but rather a rational decision made given inherent cognitive bounds and biased beliefs about the world. In this paper, we formally introduce a class of computational-rational (CR) user models for cognitively-bounded agents acting optimally under biased beliefs. The key novelty lies in explicitly modeling how a bounded memory process leads to a dynamically inconsistent and biased belief state and, consequently, sub-optimal sequential decision-making. We address the challenge of identifying the latent user-specific bound and inferring biased belief states from passive observations on the fly. We argue that for our formalized CR model family with an explicit and parameterized cognitive process, this challenge is tractable. To support our claim, we propose an efficient online inference method based on nested particle filtering that simultaneously tracks the user's latent belief state and estimates the unknown cognitive bound from a stream of observed actions. We validate our approach in a representative navigation task using memory decay as an example of a cognitive bound. With simulations, we show that (1) our CR model generates intuitively plausible behaviors corresponding to different levels of memory capacity, and (2) our inference method accurately and efficiently recovers the ground-truth cognitive bounds from limited observations ($\le 100$ steps). We further demonstrate how this approach provides a principled foundation for developing adaptive AI assistants, enabling adaptive assistance that accounts for the user's memory limitations.

<summary><strong>Mapping fNIRS Signals to Agent Performance: Toward Reinforcement Learning from Neural Feedback</strong> - Julia Santaniello, Matthew Russell, Benson Jiang, Donatello Sassaroli, Robert Jacob, Jivko SInapov - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.12844)</summary>

**Abstract:** Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is a methodology that aligns agent behavior with human preferences by integrating human feedback into the agent's training process. We introduce a possible framework that employs passive Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) to guide agent training from implicit neural signals. We present and release a novel dataset of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) recordings collected from 25 human participants across three domains: a Pick-and-Place Robot, Lunar Lander, and Flappy Bird. We train classifiers to predict levels of agent performance (optimal, sub-optimal, or worst-case) from windows of preprocessed fNIRS feature vectors, achieving an average F1 score of 67% for binary classification and 46% for multi-class models averaged across conditions and domains. We also train regressors to predict the degree of deviation between an agent's chosen action and a set of near-optimal policies, providing a continuous measure of performance. We evaluate cross-subject generalization and demonstrate that fine-tuning pre-trained models with a small sample of subject-specific data increases average F1 scores by 17% and 41% for binary and multi-class models, respectively. Our work demonstrates that mapping implicit fNIRS signals to agent performance is feasible and can be improved, laying the foundation for future brain-driven RLHF systems.

<summary><strong>Grounded by Experience: Generative Healthcare Prediction Augmented with Hierarchical Agentic Retrieval</strong> - Chuang Zhao, Hui Tang, Hongke Zhao, Xiaofang Zhou, Xiaomeng Li - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.13293)</summary>

**Abstract:** Accurate healthcare prediction is critical for improving patient outcomes and reducing operational costs. Bolstered by growing reasoning capabilities, large language models (LLMs) offer a promising path to enhance healthcare predictions by drawing on their rich parametric knowledge. However, LLMs are prone to factual inaccuracies due to limitations in the reliability and coverage of their embedded knowledge. While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) frameworks, such as GraphRAG and its variants, have been proposed to mitigate these issues by incorporating external knowledge, they face two key challenges in the healthcare scenario: (1) identifying the clinical necessity to activate the retrieval mechanism, and (2) achieving synergy between the retriever and the generator to craft contextually appropriate retrievals. To address these challenges, we propose GHAR, a \underline{g}enerative \underline{h}ierarchical \underline{a}gentic \underline{R}AG framework that simultaneously resolves when to retrieve and how to optimize the collaboration between submodules in healthcare. Specifically, for the first challenge, we design a dual-agent architecture comprising Agent-Top and Agent-Low. Agent-Top acts as the primary physician, iteratively deciding whether to rely on parametric knowledge or to initiate retrieval, while Agent-Low acts as the consulting service, summarising all task-relevant knowledge once retrieval was triggered. To tackle the second challenge, we innovatively unify the optimization of both agents within a formal Markov Decision Process, designing diverse rewards to align their shared goal of accurate prediction while preserving their distinct roles. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets across three popular tasks demonstrate our superiority over state-of-the-art baselines, highlighting the potential of hierarchical agentic RAG in advancing healthcare systems.

**Abstract:** As embodied intelligence emerges as a core frontier in artificial intelligence research, simulation platforms must evolve beyond low-level physical interactions to capture complex, human-centered social behaviors. We introduce FreeAskWorld, an interactive simulation framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) for high-level behavior planning and semantically grounded interaction, informed by theories of intention and social cognition. Our framework supports scalable, realistic human-agent simulations and includes a modular data generation pipeline tailored for diverse embodied this http URL validate the framework, we extend the classic Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) task into a interaction enriched Direction Inquiry setting, wherein agents can actively seek and interpret navigational guidance. We present and publicly release FreeAskWorld, a large-scale benchmark dataset comprising reconstructed environments, six diverse task types, 16 core object categories, 63,429 annotated sample frames, and more than 17 hours of interaction data to support training and evaluation of embodied AI systems. We benchmark VLN models, and human participants under both open-loop and closed-loop settings. Experimental results demonstrate that models fine-tuned on FreeAskWorld outperform their original counterparts, achieving enhanced semantic understanding and interaction competency. These findings underscore the efficacy of socially grounded simulation frameworks in advancing embodied AI systems toward sophisticated high-level planning and more naturalistic human-agent interaction. Importantly, our work underscores that interaction itself serves as an additional information modality.

**Abstract:** Intelligent wearable systems are at the forefront of precision medicine and play a crucial role in enhancing human-machine interaction. Traditional devices often encounter limitations due to their dependence on empirical material design and basic signal processing techniques. To overcome these issues, we introduce the concept of Human-Symbiotic Health Intelligence (HSHI), which is a framework that integrates multi-modal sensor networks with edge-cloud collaborative computing and a hybrid approach to data and knowledge modeling. HSHI is designed to adapt dynamically to both inter-individual and intra-individual variability, transitioning health management from passive monitoring to an active collaborative evolution. The framework incorporates AI-driven optimization of materials and micro-structures, provides robust interpretation of multi-modal signals, and utilizes a dual mechanism that merges population-level insights with personalized adaptations. Moreover, the integration of closed-loop optimization through reinforcement learning and digital twins facilitates customized interventions and feedback. In general, HSHI represents a significant shift in healthcare, moving towards a model that emphasizes prevention, adaptability, and a harmonious relationship between technology and health management.

<summary><strong>Clustering-Based Weight Orthogonalization for Stabilizing Deep Reinforcement Learning</strong> - Guoqing Ma, Yuhan Zhang, Yuming Dai, Guangfu Hao, Yang Chen, Shan Yu - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.11607)</summary>

**Abstract:** Reinforcement learning (RL) has made significant advancements, achieving superhuman performance in various tasks. However, RL agents often operate under the assumption of environmental stationarity, which poses a great challenge to learning efficiency since many environments are inherently non-stationary. This non-stationarity results in the requirement of millions of iterations, leading to low sample efficiency. To address this issue, we introduce the Clustering Orthogonal Weight Modified (COWM) layer, which can be integrated into the policy network of any RL algorithm and mitigate non-stationarity effectively. The COWM layer stabilizes the learning process by employing clustering techniques and a projection matrix. Our approach not only improves learning speed but also reduces gradient interference, thereby enhancing the overall learning efficiency. Empirically, the COWM outperforms state-of-the-art methods and achieves improvements of 9% and 12.6% in vision based and state-based DMControl benchmark.

<summary><strong>Environment-Aware Transfer Reinforcement Learning for Sustainable Beam Selection</strong> - Dariush Salami, Ramin Hashemi, Parham Kazemi, Mikko A. Uusitalo - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.11647)</summary>

**Abstract:** This paper presents a novel and sustainable approach for improving beam selection in 5G and beyond networks using transfer learning and Reinforcement Learning (RL). Traditional RL-based beam selection models require extensive training time and computational resources, particularly when deployed in diverse environments with varying propagation characteristics posing a major challenge for scalability and energy efficiency. To address this, we propose modeling the environment as a point cloud, where each point represents the locations of gNodeBs (gNBs) and surrounding scatterers. By computing the Chamfer distance between point clouds, structurally similar environments can be efficiently identified, enabling the reuse of pre-trained models through transfer learning. This methodology leads to a 16x reduction in training time and computational overhead, directly contributing to energy efficiency. By minimizing the need for retraining in each new deployment, our approach significantly lowers power consumption and supports the development of green and sustainable Artificial Intelligence (AI) in wireless systems. Furthermore, it accelerates time-to-deployment, reduces carbon emissions associated with training, and enhances the viability of deploying AI-driven communication systems at the edge. Simulation results confirm that our approach maintains high performance while drastically cutting energy costs, demonstrating the potential of transfer learning to enable scalable, adaptive, and environmentally conscious RL-based beam selection strategies in dynamic and diverse propagation environments.

<summary><strong>GroupRank: A Groupwise Reranking Paradigm Driven by Reinforcement Learning</strong> - Duolin Sun, Meixiu Long, Dan Yang, Yihan Jiao, Zhehao Tan, Jie Feng, Junjie Wang, Yue Shen, Peng Wei, Jian Wang, Jinjie Gu - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.11653)</summary>

**Abstract:** Large Language Models have shown strong potential as rerankers to enhance the overall performance of RAG systems. However, existing reranking paradigms are constrained by a core theoretical and practical dilemma: Pointwise methods, while simple and highly flexible, evaluate documents independently, making them prone to the Ranking Myopia Trap, overlooking the relative importance between documents. In contrast, Listwise methods can perceive the global ranking context, but suffer from inherent List Rigidity, leading to severe scalability and flexibility issues when handling large candidate sets. To address these challenges, we propose Groupwise, a novel reranking paradigm. In this approach, the query and a group of candidate documents are jointly fed into the model, which performs within-group comparisons to assign individual relevance scores to each document. This design retains the flexibility of Pointwise methods while enabling the comparative capability of Listwise methods. We further adopt GRPO for model training, equipped with a heterogeneous reward function that integrates ranking metrics with a distributional reward aimed at aligning score distributions across groups. To overcome the bottleneck caused by the scarcity of high quality labeled data, we further propose an innovative pipeline for synthesizing high quality retrieval and ranking data. The resulting data can be leveraged not only for training the reranker but also for training the retriever. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach.

<summary><strong>Enhancing Reinforcement Learning in 3D Environments through Semantic Segmentation: A Case Study in ViZDoom</strong> - Hugo Huang - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.11703)</summary>

**Abstract:** Reinforcement learning (RL) in 3D environments with high-dimensional sensory input poses two major challenges: (1) the high memory consumption induced by memory buffers required to stabilise learning, and (2) the complexity of learning in partially observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs). This project addresses these challenges by proposing two novel input representations: SS-only and RGB+SS, both employing semantic segmentation on RGB colour images. Experiments were conducted in deathmatches of ViZDoom, utilizing perfect segmentation results for controlled evaluation. Our results showed that SS-only was able to reduce the memory consumption of memory buffers by at least 66.6%, and up to 98.6% when a vectorisable lossless compression technique with minimal overhead such as run-length encoding is applied. Meanwhile, RGB+SS significantly enhances RL agents' performance with the additional semantic information provided. Furthermore, we explored density-based heatmapping as a tool to visualise RL agents' movement patterns and evaluate their suitability for data collection. A brief comparison with a previous approach highlights how our method overcame common pitfalls in applying semantic segmentation in 3D environments like ViZDoom.

<summary><strong>Treatment Stitching with Schrödinger Bridge for Enhancing Offline Reinforcement Learning in Adaptive Treatment Strategies</strong> - Dong-Hee Shin, Deok-Joong Lee, Young-Han Son, Tae-Eui Kam - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.12075)</summary>

**Abstract:** Adaptive treatment strategies (ATS) are sequential decision-making processes that enable personalized care by dynamically adjusting treatment decisions in response to evolving patient symptoms. While reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising approach for optimizing ATS, its conventional online trial-and-error learning mechanism is not permissible in clinical settings due to risks of harm to patients. Offline RL tackles this limitation by learning policies exclusively from historical treatment data, but its performance is often constrained by data scarcity-a pervasive challenge in clinical domains. To overcome this, we propose Treatment Stitching (TreatStitch), a novel data augmentation framework that generates clinically valid treatment trajectories by intelligently stitching segments from existing treatment data. Specifically, TreatStitch identifies similar intermediate patient states across different trajectories and stitches their respective segments. Even when intermediate states are too dissimilar to stitch directly, TreatStitch leverages the Schrödinger bridge method to generate smooth and energy-efficient bridging trajectories that connect dissimilar states. By augmenting these synthetic trajectories into the original dataset, offline RL can learn from a more diverse dataset, thereby improving its ability to optimize ATS. Extensive experiments across multiple treatment datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of TreatStitch in enhancing offline RL performance. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical justification showing that TreatStitch maintains clinical validity by avoiding out-of-distribution transitions.

<summary><strong>Reinforcement Learning for Charging Optimization of Inhomogeneous Dicke Quantum Batteries</strong> - Xiaobin Song, Siyuan Bai, Da-Wei Wang, Hanxiao Tao, Xizhe Wang, Rebing Wu, Benben Jiang - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.12176)</summary>

**Abstract:** Charging optimization is a key challenge to the implementation of quantum batteries, particularly under inhomogeneity and partial observability. This paper employs reinforcement learning to optimize piecewise-constant charging policies for an inhomogeneous Dicke battery. We systematically compare policies across four observability regimes, from full-state access to experimentally accessible observables (energies of individual two-level systems (TLSs), first-order averages, and second-order correlations). Simulation results demonstrate that full observability yields near-optimal ergotropy with low variability, while under partial observability, access to only single-TLS energies or energies plus first-order averages lags behind the fully observed baseline. However, augmenting partial observations with second-order correlations recovers most of the gap, reaching 94%-98% of the full-state baseline. The learned schedules are nonmyopic, trading temporary plateaus or declines for superior terminal outcomes. These findings highlight a practical route to effective fast-charging protocols under realistic information constraints.

<summary><strong>Dynamic Reward Scaling for Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection: A VAE-Enhanced Reinforcement Learning Approach</strong> - Bahareh Golchin, Banafsheh Rekabdar - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.12351)</summary>

**Abstract:** Detecting anomalies in multivariate time series is essential for monitoring complex industrial systems, where high dimensionality, limited labeled data, and subtle dependencies between sensors cause significant challenges. This paper presents a deep reinforcement learning framework that combines a Variational Autoencoder (VAE), an LSTM-based Deep Q-Network (DQN), dynamic reward shaping, and an active learning module to address these issues in a unified learning framework. The main contribution is the implementation of Dynamic Reward Scaling for Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection (DRSMT), which demonstrates how each component enhances the detection process. The VAE captures compact latent representations and reduces noise. The DQN enables adaptive, sequential anomaly classification, and the dynamic reward shaping balances exploration and exploitation during training by adjusting the importance of reconstruction and classification signals. In addition, active learning identifies the most uncertain samples for labeling, reducing the need for extensive manual supervision. Experiments on two multivariate benchmarks, namely Server Machine Dataset (SMD) and Water Distribution Testbed (WADI), show that the proposed method outperforms existing baselines in F1-score and AU-PR. These results highlight the effectiveness of combining generative modeling, reinforcement learning, and selective supervision for accurate and scalable anomaly detection in real-world multivariate systems.

<summary><strong>Asymptotic analysis of cooperative censoring policies in sensor networks</strong> - Jesus Fernandez-Bes, Rocío Arroyo-Valles, Jesús Cid-Sueiro - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.13492)</summary>

**Abstract:** The problem of cooperative data censoring in battery-powered multihop sensor networks is analyzed in this paper. We are interested in scenarios where nodes generate messages (which are related to the sensor measurements) that can be graded with some importance value. Less important messages can be censored in order to save energy for later communications. The problem is modeled using a joint Markov Decision Process of the whole network dynamics, and a theoretically optimal censoring policy, which maximizes a long-term reward, is found. Though the optimal censoring rules are computationally prohibitive, our analysis suggests that, under some conditions, they can be approximated by a finite collection of constant-threshold rules. A centralized algorithm for the computation of these thresholds is proposed. The experimental simulations show that cooperative censoring policies are energy-efficient, and outperform other non-cooperative schemes.

<summary><strong>See it. Say it. Sorted: Agentic System for Compositional Diagram Generation</strong> - Hantao Zhang, Jingyang Liu, Ed Li - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.15222)</summary>

**Abstract:** We study sketch-to-diagram generation: converting rough hand sketches into precise, compositional diagrams. Diffusion models excel at photorealism but struggle with the spatial precision, alignment, and symbolic structure required for flowcharts. We introduce See it. Say it. Sorted., a training-free agentic system that couples a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with Large Language Models (LLMs) to produce editable Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) programs. The system runs an iterative loop in which a Critic VLM proposes a small set of qualitative, relational edits; multiple candidate LLMs synthesize SVG updates with diverse strategies (conservative->aggressive, alternative, focused); and a Judge VLM selects the best candidate, ensuring stable improvement. This design prioritizes qualitative reasoning over brittle numerical estimates, preserves global constraints (e.g., alignment, connectivity), and naturally supports human-in-the-loop corrections. On 10 sketches derived from flowcharts in published papers, our method more faithfully reconstructs layout and structure than two frontier closed-source image generation LLMs (GPT-5 and Gemini-2.5-Pro), accurately composing primitives (e.g., multi-headed arrows) without inserting unwanted text. Because outputs are programmatic SVGs, the approach is readily extensible to presentation tools (e.g., PowerPoint) via APIs and can be specialized with improved prompts and task-specific tools.

**Abstract:** We present MiroThinker v1.0, an open-source research agent designed to advance tool-augmented reasoning and information-seeking capabilities. Unlike previous agents that only scale up model size or context length, MiroThinker explores interaction scaling at the model level, systematically training the model to handle deeper and more frequent agent-environment interactions as a third dimension of performance improvement. Unlike LLM test-time scaling, which operates in isolation and risks degradation with longer reasoning chains, interactive scaling leverages environment feedback and external information acquisition to correct errors and refine trajectories. Through reinforcement learning, the model achieves efficient interaction scaling: with a 256K context window, it can perform up to 600 tool calls per task, enabling sustained multi-turn reasoning and complex real-world research workflows. Across four representative benchmarks-GAIA, HLE, BrowseComp, and BrowseComp-ZH-the 72B variant achieves up to 81.9%, 37.7%, 47.1%, and 55.6% accuracy respectively, surpassing previous open-source agents and approaching commercial counterparts such as GPT-5-high. Our analysis reveals that MiroThinker benefits from interactive scaling consistently: research performance improves predictably as the model engages in deeper and more frequent agent-environment interactions, demonstrating that interaction depth exhibits scaling behaviors analogous to model size and context length. These findings establish interaction scaling as a third critical dimension for building next-generation open research agents, complementing model capacity and context windows.

<summary><strong>Context-Emotion Aware Therapeutic Dialogue Generation: A Multi-component Reinforcement Learning Approach to Language Models for Mental Health Support</strong> - Eric Hua Qing Zhang, Julia Ive - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.11884)</summary>

**Abstract:** Mental health illness represents a substantial global socioeconomic burden, with COVID-19 further exacerbating accessibility challenges and driving increased demand for telehealth mental health support. While large language models (LLMs) offer promising solutions through 24/7 availability and non-judgmental interactions, pre-trained models often lack the contextual and emotional awareness necessary for appropriate therapeutic responses. This paper investigated the application of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to enhance GPT-2's capacity for therapeutic dialogue generation. The methodology restructured input formats to enable simultaneous processing of contextual information and emotional states alongside user input, employing a multi-component reward function that aligned model outputs with professional therapist responses and annotated emotions. Results demonstrated improvements through reinforcement learning over baseline GPT-2 across multiple evaluation metrics: BLEU (0.0111), ROUGE-1 (0.1397), ROUGE-2 (0.0213), ROUGE-L (0.1317), and METEOR (0.0581). LLM evaluation confirmed high contextual relevance and professionalism, while reinforcement learning achieved 99.34% emotion accuracy compared to 66.96% for baseline GPT-2. These findings demonstrate reinforcement learning's effectiveness in developing therapeutic dialogue systems that can serve as valuable assistive tools for therapists while maintaining essential human clinical oversight.

<summary><strong>CriticSearch: Fine-Grained Credit Assignment for Search Agents via a Retrospective Critic</strong> - Yaocheng Zhang, Haohuan Huang, Zijun Song, Yuanheng Zhu, Qichao Zhang, Zijie Zhao, Dongbin Zhao - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.12159)</summary>

**Abstract:** Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) with search engines enables large language models to iteratively retrieve up-to-date external knowledge, enhancing adaptability and generalization in complex question-answering tasks. However, existing search agent pipelines typically depend on reinforcement learning based optimization, which often suffers from sparse outcome rewards, leading to inefficient exploration and unstable training. We introduce CriticSearch, a fine-grained credit-assignment framework that supplies dense, turn-level feedback via a retrospective critic mechanism. During training, a frozen, asymmetric critique LLM retrospectively evaluates each turn using privileged information from the full trajectory and gold answers, converting these assessments into stable, dense rewards that guide policy improvement. Experimental results across diverse multi-hop reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that CriticSearch consistently outperforms existing baselines, achieving faster convergence, improved training stability, and higher performance.

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) often suffer from mode collapse, repeatedly generating the same few completions even when many valid answers exist, limiting their diversity across a wide range of tasks. We introduce Group-Aware Policy Optimization (GAPO), a simple extension of the recent and popular Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) that computes rewards over the group as a whole. GAPO enables learning from the group-level properties such as diversity and coverage. We demonstrate GAPO using a frequency-aware reward function that encourages uniform sampling over valid LLM completions, and show that GAPO-trained models produce valid and more diverse model responses. Beyond this setup, GAPO generalizes to open-ended prompts and improves response diversity without compromising accuracy on standard LLM benchmarks (GSM8K, MATH, HumanEval, MMLU-Pro). Our code will be made publicly available.

**Abstract:** Recent advancements in LLM-powered agents have demonstrated significant potential in generating human-like responses; however, they continue to face challenges in maintaining long-term interactions within complex environments, primarily due to limitations in contextual consistency and dynamic personalization. Existing memory systems often depend on semantic grouping prior to retrieval, which can overlook semantically irrelevant yet critical user information and introduce retrieval noise. In this report, we propose the initial design of O-Mem, a novel memory framework based on active user profiling that dynamically extracts and updates user characteristics and event records from their proactive interactions with agents. O-Mem supports hierarchical retrieval of persona attributes and topic-related context, enabling more adaptive and coherent personalized responses. O-Mem achieves 51.67% on the public LoCoMo benchmark, a nearly 3% improvement upon LangMem,the previous state-of-the-art, and it achieves 62.99% on PERSONAMEM, a 3.5% improvement upon A-Mem,the previous state-of-the-art. O-Mem also boosts token and interaction response time efficiency compared to previous memory frameworks. Our work opens up promising directions for developing efficient and human-like personalized AI assistants in the future.

**Abstract:** Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has moved the frontier from puzzle-solving to science-grade reasoning-the kind needed to tackle problems whose answers must stand against nature, not merely fit a rubric. Physics is the sharpest test of this shift, which binds symbols to reality in a fundamental way, serving as the cornerstone of most modern technologies. In this work, we manage to advance physics research by developing large language models with exceptional physics reasoning capabilities, especially excel at solving Olympiad-level physics problems. We introduce P1, a family of open-source physics reasoning models trained entirely through reinforcement learning (RL). Among them, P1-235B-A22B is the first open-source model with Gold-medal performance at the latest International Physics Olympiad (IPhO 2025), and wins 12 gold medals out of 13 international/regional physics competitions in 2024/2025. P1-30B-A3B also surpasses almost all other open-source models on IPhO 2025, getting a silver medal. Further equipped with an agentic framework PhysicsMinions, P1-235B-A22B+PhysicsMinions achieves overall No.1 on IPhO 2025, and obtains the highest average score over the 13 physics competitions. Besides physics, P1 models also present great performance on other reasoning tasks like math and coding, showing the great generalibility of P1 series.

**Abstract:** The automation of scientific research through large language models (LLMs) presents significant opportunities but faces critical challenges in knowledge synthesis and quality assurance. We introduce Feedback-Refined Agent Methodology (FRAME), a novel framework that enhances medical paper generation through iterative refinement and structured feedback. Our approach comprises three key innovations: (1) A structured dataset construction method that decomposes 4,287 medical papers into essential research components through iterative refinement; (2) A tripartite architecture integrating Generator, Evaluator, and Reflector agents that progressively improve content quality through metric-driven feedback; and (3) A comprehensive evaluation framework that combines statistical metrics with human-grounded benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate FRAME's effectiveness, achieving significant improvements over conventional approaches across multiple models (9.91% average gain with DeepSeek V3, comparable improvements with GPT-4o Mini) and evaluation dimensions. Human evaluation confirms that FRAME-generated papers achieve quality comparable to human-authored works, with particular strength in synthesizing future research directions. The results demonstrated our work could efficiently assist medical research by building a robust foundation for automated medical research paper generation while maintaining rigorous academic standards.

**Abstract:** The deployment of decision-making AI agents presents a critical challenge in maintaining alignment with human values or guidelines while operating in complex, dynamic environments. Agents trained solely to achieve their objectives may adopt harmful behavior, exposing a key trade-off between maximizing the reward function and maintaining alignment. For pre-trained agents, ensuring alignment is particularly challenging, as retraining can be a costly and slow process. This is further complicated by the diverse and potentially conflicting attributes representing the ethical values for alignment. To address these challenges, we propose a test-time alignment technique based on model-guided policy shaping. Our method allows precise control over individual behavioral attributes, generalizes across diverse reinforcement learning (RL) environments, and facilitates a principled trade-off between ethical alignment and reward maximization without requiring agent retraining. We evaluate our approach using the MACHIAVELLI benchmark, which comprises 134 text-based game environments and thousands of annotated scenarios involving ethical decisions. The RL agents are first trained to maximize the reward in their respective games. At test time, we apply policy shaping via scenario-action attribute classifiers to ensure decision alignment with ethical attributes. We compare our approach against prior training-time methods and general-purpose agents, as well as study several types of ethical violations and power-seeking behavior. Our results demonstrate that test-time policy shaping provides an effective and scalable solution for mitigating unethical behavior across diverse environments and alignment attributes.

<summary><strong>Integrating Neural Differential Forecasting with Safe Reinforcement Learning for Blood Glucose Regulation</strong> - Yushen Liu, Yanfu Zhang, Xugui Zhou - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.12417)</summary>

**Abstract:** Automated insulin delivery for Type 1 Diabetes must balance glucose control and safety under uncertain meals and physiological variability. While reinforcement learning (RL) enables adaptive personalization, existing approaches struggle to simultaneously guarantee safety, leaving a gap in achieving both personalized and risk-aware glucose control, such as overdosing before meals or stacking corrections. To bridge this gap, we propose TSODE, a safety-aware controller that integrates Thompson Sampling RL with a Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (NeuralODE) forecaster to address this challenge. Specifically, the NeuralODE predicts short-term glucose trajectories conditioned on proposed insulin doses, while a conformal calibration layer quantifies predictive uncertainty to reject or scale risky actions. In the FDA-approved UVa/Padova simulator (adult cohort), TSODE achieved 87.9% time-in-range with less than 10% time below 70 mg/dL, outperforming relevant baselines. These results demonstrate that integrating adaptive RL with calibrated NeuralODE forecasting enables interpretable, safe, and robust glucose regulation.

**Abstract:** Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). While RL has demonstrated substantial performance gains, it still faces key challenges, including low sampling efficiency and a strong dependence on model initialization: some models achieve rapid improvements with minimal RL steps, while others require significant training data to make progress. In this work, we investigate these challenges through the lens of reasoning token coverage and argue that initializing LLMs with diverse, high-quality reasoning primitives is essential for achieving stable and sample-efficient RL training. We propose Tailor, a finetuning pipeline that automatically discovers and curates novel reasoning primitives, thereby expanding the coverage of reasoning-state distributions before RL. Extensive experiments on mathematical and logical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that Tailor generates more diverse and higher-quality warm-start data, resulting in higher downstream RL performance.

**Abstract:** Autonomous vehicle navigation in complex environments such as dense and fast-moving highways and merging scenarios remains an active area of research. A key limitation of RL is its reliance on well-specified reward functions, which often fail to capture the full semantic and social complexity of diverse, out-of-distribution situations. As a result, a rapidly growing line of research explores using Large Language Models (LLMs) to replace or supplement RL for direct planning and control, on account of their ability to reason about rich semantic context. However, LLMs present significant drawbacks: they can be unstable in zero-shot safety-critical settings, produce inconsistent outputs, and often depend on expensive API calls with network latency. This motivates our investigation into whether small, locally deployed LLMs (< 14B parameters) can meaningfully support autonomous highway driving through reward shaping rather than direct control. We present a case study comparing RL-only, LLM-only, and hybrid approaches, where LLMs augment RL rewards by scoring state-action transitions during training, while standard RL policies execute at test time. Our findings reveal that RL-only agents achieve moderate success rates (73-89%) with reasonable efficiency, LLM-only agents can reach higher success rates (up to 94%) but with severely degraded speed performance, and hybrid approaches consistently fall between these extremes. Critically, despite explicit efficiency instructions, LLM-influenced approaches exhibit systematic conservative bias with substantial model-dependent variability, highlighting important limitations of current small LLMs for safety-critical control tasks.

<summary><strong>Scalable Multi-Objective and Meta Reinforcement Learning via Gradient Estimation</strong> - Zhenshuo Zhang, Minxuan Duan, Youran Ye, Hongyang R. Zhang - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.12779)</summary>

**Abstract:** We study the problem of efficiently estimating policies that simultaneously optimize multiple objectives in reinforcement learning (RL). Given $n$ objectives (or tasks), we seek the optimal partition of these objectives into $k \ll n$ groups, where each group comprises related objectives that can be trained together. This problem arises in applications such as robotics, control, and preference optimization in language models, where learning a single policy for all $n$ objectives is suboptimal as $n$ grows. We introduce a two-stage procedure -- meta-training followed by fine-tuning -- to address this problem. We first learn a meta-policy for all objectives using multitask learning. Then, we adapt the meta-policy to multiple randomly sampled subsets of objectives. The adaptation step leverages a first-order approximation property of well-trained policy networks, which is empirically verified to be accurate within a $2\%$ error margin across various RL environments. The resulting algorithm, PolicyGradEx, efficiently estimates an aggregate task-affinity score matrix given a policy evaluation algorithm. Based on the estimated affinity score matrix, we cluster the $n$ objectives into $k$ groups by maximizing the intra-cluster affinity scores. Experiments on three robotic control and the Meta-World benchmarks demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by $16\%$ on average, while delivering up to $26\times$ faster speedup relative to performing full training to obtain the clusters. Ablation studies validate each component of our approach. For instance, compared with random grouping and gradient-similarity-based grouping, our loss-based clustering yields an improvement of $19\%$. Finally, we analyze the generalization error of policy networks by measuring the Hessian trace of the loss surface, which gives non-vacuous measures relative to the observed generalization errors.

<summary><strong>An approach of deep reinforcement learning for maximizing the net present value of stochastic projects</strong> - Wei Xu, Fan Yang, Qinyuan Cui, Zhi Chen - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.12865)</summary>

**Abstract:** This paper investigates a project with stochastic activity durations and cash flows under discrete scenarios, where activities must satisfy precedence constraints generating cash inflows and outflows. The objective is to maximize expected net present value (NPV) by accelerating inflows and deferring outflows. We formulate the problem as a discrete-time Markov Decision Process (MDP) and propose a Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) approach. Comparative experiments demonstrate that DDQN outperforms traditional rigid and dynamic strategies, particularly in large-scale or highly uncertain environments, exhibiting superior computational capability, policy reliability, and adaptability. Ablation studies further reveal that the dual-network architecture mitigates overestimation of action values, while the target network substantially improves training convergence and robustness. These results indicate that DDQN not only achieves higher expected NPV in complex project optimization but also provides a reliable framework for stable and effective policy implementation.

**Abstract:** Multi-task reinforcement learning (MTRL) seeks to learn a unified policy for diverse tasks, but often suffers from gradient conflicts across tasks. Existing masking-based methods attempt to mitigate such conflicts by assigning task-specific parameter masks. However, our empirical study shows that coarse-grained binary masks have the problem of over-suppressing key conflicting parameters, hindering knowledge sharing across tasks. Moreover, different tasks exhibit varying conflict levels, yet existing methods use a one-size-fits-all fixed sparsity strategy to keep training stability and performance, which proves inadequate. These limitations hinder the model's generalization and learning efficiency.
To address these issues, we propose SoCo-DT, a Soft Conflict-resolution method based by parameter importance. By leveraging Fisher information, mask values are dynamically adjusted to retain important parameters while suppressing conflicting ones. In addition, we introduce a dynamic sparsity adjustment strategy based on the Interquartile Range (IQR), which constructs task-specific thresholding schemes using the distribution of conflict and harmony scores during training. To enable adaptive sparsity evolution throughout training, we further incorporate an asymmetric cosine annealing schedule to continuously update the threshold. Experimental results on the Meta-World benchmark show that SoCo-DT outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 7.6% on MT50 and by 10.5% on the suboptimal dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in mitigating gradient conflicts and improving overall multi-task performance.

<summary><strong>Finding Kissing Numbers with Game-theoretic Reinforcement Learning</strong> - Chengdong Ma, Théo Tao Zhaowei, Pengyu Li, Minghao Liu, Haojun Chen, Zihao Mao, Yuan Cheng, Yuan Qi, Yaodong Yang - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.13391)</summary>

**Abstract:** Since Isaac Newton first studied the Kissing Number Problem in 1694, determining the maximal number of non-overlapping spheres around a central sphere has remained a fundamental challenge. This problem represents the local analogue of Hilbert's 18th problem on sphere packing, bridging geometry, number theory, and information theory. Although significant progress has been made through lattices and codes, the irregularities of high-dimensional geometry and exponentially growing combinatorial complexity beyond 8 dimensions, which exceeds the complexity of Go game, limit the scalability of existing methods. Here we model this problem as a two-player matrix completion game and train the game-theoretic reinforcement learning system, PackingStar, to efficiently explore high-dimensional spaces. The matrix entries represent pairwise cosines of sphere center vectors; one player fills entries while another corrects suboptimal ones, jointly maximizing the matrix size, corresponding to the kissing number. This cooperative dynamics substantially improves sample quality, making the extremely large spaces tractable. PackingStar reproduces previous configurations and surpasses all human-known records from dimensions 25 to 31, with the configuration in 25 dimensions geometrically corresponding to the Leech lattice and suggesting possible optimality. It achieves the first breakthrough beyond rational structures from 1971 in 13 dimensions and discovers over 6000 new structures in 14 and other dimensions. These results demonstrate AI's power to explore high-dimensional spaces beyond human intuition and open new pathways for the Kissing Number Problem and broader geometry problems.

<summary><strong>Large Language Models and 3D Vision for Intelligent Robotic Perception and Autonomy</strong> - Vinit Mehta, Charu Sharma, Karthick Thiyagarajan - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.11777)</summary>

**Abstract:** With the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence and robotics, the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with 3D vision is emerging as a transformative approach to enhancing robotic sensing technologies. This convergence enables machines to perceive, reason and interact with complex environments through natural language and spatial understanding, bridging the gap between linguistic intelligence and spatial perception. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of state-of-the-art methodologies, applications and challenges at the intersection of LLMs and 3D vision, with a focus on next-generation robotic sensing technologies. We first introduce the foundational principles of LLMs and 3D data representations, followed by an in-depth examination of 3D sensing technologies critical for robotics. The review then explores key advancements in scene understanding, text-to-3D generation, object grounding and embodied agents, highlighting cutting-edge techniques such as zero-shot 3D segmentation, dynamic scene synthesis and language-guided manipulation. Furthermore, we discuss multimodal LLMs that integrate 3D data with touch, auditory and thermal inputs, enhancing environmental comprehension and robotic decision-making. To support future research, we catalog benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics tailored for 3D-language and vision tasks. Finally, we identify key challenges and future research directions, including adaptive model architectures, enhanced cross-modal alignment and real-time processing capabilities, which pave the way for more intelligent, context-aware and autonomous robotic sensing systems.

<summary><strong>SAC-MoE: Reinforcement Learning with Mixture-of-Experts for Control of Hybrid Dynamical Systems with Uncertainty</strong> - Leroy D'Souza, Akash Karthikeyan, Yash Vardhan Pant, Sebastian Fischmeister - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.12361)</summary>

**Abstract:** Hybrid dynamical systems result from the interaction of continuous-variable dynamics with discrete events and encompass various systems such as legged robots, vehicles and aircrafts. Challenges arise when the system's modes are characterized by unobservable (latent) parameters and the events that cause system dynamics to switch between different modes are also unobservable. Model-based control approaches typically do not account for such uncertainty in the hybrid dynamics, while standard model-free RL methods fail to account for abrupt mode switches, leading to poor generalization.
To overcome this, we propose SAC-MoE which models the actor of the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) framework as a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with a learned router that adaptively selects among learned experts. To further improve robustness, we develop a curriculum-based training algorithm to prioritize data collection in challenging settings, allowing better generalization to unseen modes and switching locations. Simulation studies in hybrid autonomous racing and legged locomotion tasks show that SAC-MoE outperforms baselines (up to 6x) in zero-shot generalization to unseen environments. Our curriculum strategy consistently improves performance across all evaluated policies. Qualitative analysis shows that the interpretable MoE router activates different experts for distinct latent modes.

<summary><strong>Task-Aware Morphology Optimization of Planar Manipulators via Reinforcement Learning</strong> - Arvind Kumar Mishra, Sohom Chakrabarty - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.12650)</summary>

**Abstract:** In this work, Yoshikawa's manipulability index is used to investigate reinforcement learning (RL) as a framework for morphology optimization in planar robotic manipulators. A 2R manipulator tracking a circular end-effector path is first examined because this case has a known analytical optimum: equal link lengths and the second joint orthogonal to the first. This serves as a validation step to test whether RL can rediscover the optimum using reward feedback alone, without access to the manipulability expression or the Jacobian. Three RL algorithms (SAC, DDPG, and PPO) are compared with grid search and black-box optimizers, with morphology represented by a single action parameter phi that maps to the link lengths. All methods converge to the analytical solution, showing that numerical recovery of the optimum is possible without supplying analytical structure.
Most morphology design tasks have no closed-form solutions, and grid or heuristic search becomes expensive as dimensionality increases. RL is therefore explored as a scalable alternative. The formulation used for the circular path is extended to elliptical and rectangular paths by expanding the action space to the full morphology vector (L1, L2, theta2). In these non-analytical settings, RL continues to converge reliably, whereas grid and black-box methods require far larger evaluation budgets. These results indicate that RL is effective for both recovering known optima and solving morphology optimization problems without analytical solutions.

<summary><strong>Prompt-Driven Domain Adaptation for End-to-End Autonomous Driving via In-Context RL</strong> - Aleesha Khurram, Amir Moeini, Shangtong Zhang, Rohan Chandra - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.12755)</summary>

**Abstract:** Despite significant progress and advances in autonomous driving, many end-to-end systems still struggle with domain adaptation (DA), such as transferring a policy trained under clear weather to adverse weather conditions. Typical DA strategies in the literature include collecting additional data in the target domain or re-training the model, or both. Both these strategies quickly become impractical as we increase scale and complexity of driving. These limitations have encouraged investigation into few-shot and zero-shot prompt-driven DA at inference time involving LLMs and VLMs. These methods work by adding a few state-action trajectories during inference to the prompt (similar to in-context learning). However, there are two limitations of such an approach: $(i)$ prompt-driven DA methods are currently restricted to perception tasks such as detection and segmentation and $(ii)$ they require expert few-shot data. In this work, we present a new approach to inference-time few-shot prompt-driven DA for closed-loop autonomous driving in adverse weather condition using in-context reinforcement learning (ICRL). Similar to other prompt-driven DA methods, our approach does not require any updates to the model parameters nor does it require additional data collection in adversarial weather regime. Furthermore, our approach advances the state-of-the-art in prompt-driven DA by extending to closed driving using general trajectories observed during inference. Our experiments using the CARLA simulator show that ICRL results in safer, more efficient, and more comfortable driving policies in the target domain compared to state-of-the-art prompt-driven DA baselines.

<summary><strong>Contact-Safe Reinforcement Learning with ProMP Reparameterization and Energy Awareness</strong> - Bingkun Huang, Yuhe Gong, Zewen Yang, Tianyu Ren, Luis Figueredo - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.13459)</summary>

**Abstract:** Reinforcement learning (RL) approaches based on Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) are predominantly applied in the robot joint space, often relying on limited task-specific information and partial awareness of the 3D environment. In contrast, episodic RL has demonstrated advantages over traditional MDP-based methods in terms of trajectory consistency, task awareness, and overall performance in complex robotic tasks. Moreover, traditional step-wise and episodic RL methods often neglect the contact-rich information inherent in task-space manipulation, especially considering the contact-safety and robustness. In this work, contact-rich manipulation tasks are tackled using a task-space, energy-safe framework, where reliable and safe task-space trajectories are generated through the combination of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and movement primitives. Furthermore, an energy-aware Cartesian Impedance Controller objective is incorporated within the proposed framework to ensure safe interactions between the robot and the environment. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms existing methods in handling tasks on various types of surfaces in 3D environments, achieving high success rates as well as smooth trajectories and energy-safe interactions.

<summary><strong>Coordinated Humanoid Robot Locomotion with Symmetry Equivariant Reinforcement Learning Policy</strong> - Buqing Nie, Yang Zhang, Rongjun Jin, Zhanxiang Cao, Huangxuan Lin, Xiaokang Yang, Yue Gao - [[pdf]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.01247)</summary>

**Abstract:** The human nervous system exhibits bilateral symmetry, enabling coordinated and balanced movements. However, existing Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) methods for humanoid robots neglect morphological symmetry of the robot, leading to uncoordinated and suboptimal behaviors. Inspired by human motor control, we propose Symmetry Equivariant Policy (SE-Policy), a new DRL framework that embeds strict symmetry equivariance in the actor and symmetry invariance in the critic without additional hyperparameters. SE-Policy enforces consistent behaviors across symmetric observations, producing temporally and spatially coordinated motions with higher task performance. Extensive experiments on velocity tracking tasks, conducted in both simulation and real-world deployment with the Unitree G1 humanoid robot, demonstrate that SE-Policy improves tracking accuracy by up to 40% compared to state-of-the-art baselines, while achieving superior spatial-temporal coordination. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of SE-Policy and its broad applicability to humanoid robots.
